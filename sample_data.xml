{{Donald Trump series}}
U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] currently has six residences.

Trump grew up in [[Jamaica Estates]], an affluent neighborhood in [[Queens]], [[New York City]]. During his time at the [[New York Military Academy]], he lived on campus; he later rented [[row house]]s in college. In 1971, Trump moved to a studio on 75th Street in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="ForbesALL"/&gt; Since the completion of [[Trump Tower]] in 1983, Trump has lived in a three-level penthouse on the top floors. He purchased the Seven Springs mansion in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]], in 1995. Upon Trump's election to the US presidency, he moved into the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], while First Lady [[Melania Trump|Melania]] and their son initially stayed at Trump Tower in [[Manhattan]] until the end of the school year before moving to the White House as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/12/melania-barron-trump-move-into-white-house|title=Melania and Barron Trump officially move into White House|first=Associated|last=Press|date=June 12, 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his birth in 1946 until 2019, Trump listed his primary state of residence as [[New York (state)|New York]]; in September 2019, Donald and Melania moved their primary residence to [[Mar-a-Lago]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=cbsnewsresidence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-primary-residence-trump-moving-primary-residence-from-new-york-city-to-florida/|title=Lifelong New Yorker Trump moving primary residence to Florida|first=Caroline|last=Linton|publisher=CBS News|date=October 31, 2019|accessdate=November 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytresidency /&gt;

===Mar-a-Lago===
[[File:Maralago1 (4158314102).jpg|thumb|[[Mar-a-Lago]]]]
{{Main|Mar-a-Lago}}

Since September 2019, Trump's resort and residence Mar-a-Lago has served as the primary residence for Donald and Melania Trump.&lt;ref name=nytresidency&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/trump-new-york-florida-primary-residence.html|title=Trump, Lifelong New Yorker, Declares Himself a Resident of Florida|first=Maggie|last=Haberman|publisher=New York Times|date=October 31, 2019|accessdate=November 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbsnewsresidence /&gt; The legality of this has been disputed because, in 1993, Trump signed a "use agreement" with the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Town of Palm Beach, Florida]] that changed Mar-a-Lago's designation from a single-family residence to a private club.

===Seven Springs===
Trump owns a {{convert|39000|sqft}} mansion on {{convert|213|acre}} in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]] and [[New Castle, New York]]. The mansion has an indoor pool of white marble on its first floor and sixty rooms, including thirteen bedrooms and twelve baths.&lt;ref name="ForbesALL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The property has a glass and stone orangery for growing citrus, with a bowling alley in its basement. Also on the property is a formal garden pavilion, a fountain in the front lawn, a greenhouse and root cellar, stone water tower, and a Tudor Revival house and courtyard known by the name of "Nonesuch".&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

It was formerly the home of [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]] and his family, including [[Katharine Graham]]. In 1919, Meyer had artist and architect [[Charles A. Platt]] design the mansion of sandstone from the property. He spent $2 million constructing it. Trump purchased the property in 1995 for $7.5 million. Trump originally planned to build a golf course there, however he was opposed by the governments of the three municipalities the property lies within, and he wanted to prevent a new course competing with his [[Trump National Golf Club Westchester|existing course]] nearby in [[Briarcliff Manor]]. Trump's plans changed for Seven Springs to include building fifteen mansions, each to sell for about $25 million, and renovating the two existing houses.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/realestate/homes-by-and-for-donald-trump.html|title=Homes by (and for) Donald Trump|first=Elsa|last=Brenner|date=May 21, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=April 14, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Trump placed most of the property under a [[conservation easement]], apparently signaling the abandonment of any major development plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seven Springs, Trump's N.Y. property, spared spotlight — for now|newspaper=USA Today|first=Michael P.|last=McKinney|date=April 25, 2017|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/04/25/seven-springs-trumps-ny-property-spared-spotlight-now/100905078/|accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queens, New York City===
[[File:85-15 Wareham Place, Trump childhood home.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[85-15 Wareham Place]]]]
Trump lived with his family in [[Jamaica Estates]], an affluent suburban neighborhood in [[Queens]]. They lived at [[85-15 Wareham Place]] until he was four. The house, a six-bedroom [[neo-Tudor]], was built in 1940 by his father [[Fred Trump]]. In 1950, the family moved into a nine-room [[Colonial Revival]] house built on two adjoining lots on Midland Parkway, directly behind the backyard of the house on Wareham Place.{{sfn|Kranish|Fisher|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=x2jUDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 32]}}&lt;ref name="ForbesALL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald Trump's Estates Through The Years (Pre-White House)|first=Keith|last=Flamer|publisher=|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/keithflamer/2016/05/27/deconstructing-donald-trump-a-homespun-tale-4/#6c32e1b05c9f|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warren|first=Katie|title=I visited Trump's childhood neighborhood on the outskirts of NYC, and it didn't take long to see why he's called it an 'oasis'|website=Business Insider|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-childhood-neighborhood-queens-new-york-city-photos-2018-11|date=December 19, 2019|access-date=March 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over several decades, Trump's parents gradually retrofitted the house into a 23-room [[mansion]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trump/ZQ_9CwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=jamaica%20estates&lt;/ref&gt; and resided there for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Kevin|title=Tripping to Trumpville|work=Splice Today|url=https://www.splicetoday.com/writing/tripping-to-trumpville|accessdate=March 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School living===

===Manhattan penthouse===
Around the 1970s Trump lived in a penthouse apartment at the Phoenix, a luxury apartment building on 65th Street in the [[Upper East Side]] in [[Manhattan]]. The apartment had large panoramic windows; he decorated the interior in beige, brown, and chrome.&lt;ref name="ForbesALL"/&gt;

===Greenwich mansion===
Trump purchased a {{convert|20000|sqft|adj=on}} mansion in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], in 1982 for $4 million. The house has eight bedrooms, eleven baths, a {{convert|4000|sqft}} guest house, a putting green and tennis court, indoor and outdoor pools, and a sauna.&lt;ref name="ForbesALL"/&gt;

===Fifth Avenue apartment===
Trump and his wife Ivana lived in an apartment on Manhattan's [[Fifth Avenue]], which was decorated with beige velvet sofas and goatskin tables.&lt;ref name="ForbesALL"/&gt; According to family friend Nikki Haskell, Donald and Ivana lived in [[Olympic Tower]] prior to moving to 800 Fifth Avenue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-frontline-interview-nikki-haskell/|title=The FRONTLINE Interview: Nikki Haskell|date=September 27, 2016|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beverly Hills===
Trump owned a five-bedroom mansion on North Rodeo Drive in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from 2007 to 2019. Trump had rarely used it, and had put on the market and rented it out at different times.&lt;ref name="ForbesALL"/&gt; In June 2019, he quietly sold the property, off-market, for $13.5 million. He had originally purchased it for $7 million, and claimed the house was worth $6 million for tax purposes.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite web|last=Flemming|first=Jack|title=Donald Trump’s Beverly Hills home quietly sells for $13.5 million|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-trump-organization-beverly-hills-20190612-story.html|date=June 12, 2019|accessdate=March 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008 to 2009, Trump owned a neighboring house, an 11-bedroom Greek Revival mansion built in 1981. Trump purchased it for $10.35 million, but sold it for $9.5 million. It was previously a residence of [[Gabon|Gabonese]] president [[Omar Bongo]], who died in office in 2009.&lt;ref name="lat2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Leitereg|first=Neal J.|title=The high price of living next door to Donald Trump in L.A.: $30 million|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-donald-trump-former-home-beverly-hills-20160809-snap-story.html|date=August 9, 2016|accessdate=March 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump]], an American businessman, politician, and [[List of Presidents of the United States|45th]] [[President of the United States|president]] of the [[United States]], has &lt;!--Not "allegedly", because his court testimony proved he did it.--&gt; used several pseudonyms, including "John Barron" (or "John Baron"), "John Miller" and "David Dennison". His practice of sometimes speaking to the media under the guise of a spokesperson has been described as "an open secret" at [[the Trump Organization]] and in New York media circles.&lt;ref name="Diamond" /&gt; Some New York editors recalled that "calls from Barron were at points so common that they became a recurring joke on the city desk."&lt;ref name="Kimble" /&gt; A writer for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' reported that Trump's father [[Fred Trump]] had used the pseudonym Mr. Green in business dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/donald-trump-fake-names/|title=Donald Trump's Long, Strange History of Using Fake Names|last=D'Antonio|first=Michael|date=May 18, 2016|work=Fortune|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="John Barron" (1980s)==
Trump used the pseudonym "John Barron" (sometimes "John Baron") throughout the 1980s, with its earliest known usage in 1980 and its last acknowledgment in 1990. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the name was a "go-to alias when [Trump] was under scrutiny, in need of a tough front man or otherwise wanting to convey a message without attaching his own name to it."&lt;ref name="Borchers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Borchers|first=Callum|title=The amazing story of Donald Trump's old spokesman, John Barron – who was actually Donald Trump himself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/21/the-amazing-story-of-donald-trumps-old-spokesman-john-barron-who-was-actually-donald-trump-himself/|accessdate=July 20, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barron would be introduced as a spokesperson for Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Taking a Bath on Madison|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=August 13, 1984|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-UCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA9&amp;dq=%22spokesman+john+barron%22#v=onepage|language=en|last=Churcher|first=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pseudonym first appeared within a June 6, 1980 ''New York Times'' article about Trump's decision to destroy two controversial sculptures from the [[Bonwit Teller]] flagship store (now the site of [[Trump Tower]]) that he had promised to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. "Barron", describing himself as "a Trump Organization vice president", acted as the spokesperson for Trump for three days in that case.&lt;ref name="Surico"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/remembering-john-barron-donald-trumps-spokesman-alter-ego-116|title=Remembering John Barron, Donald Trump's 'Spokesman' Alter Ego|last=Surico|first=John|date=November 6, 2015|work=Vice|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump continued to pose as "Barron" on occasion for the rest of the decade. In 1983 "Barron" told the press that Trump had decided not to purchase the [[Cleveland Indians]].&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-posed-john-barron-times-article-1.2636536|title=Donald Trump has apparently gotten away with posing as his own publicist 'John Barron' many times before|last=Joseph|first=Cameron|date=May 13, 2016|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1984, "Barron" lied to then-''[[Forbes]]'' reporter Jonathan Greenberg about Trump's wealth and assets to get Trump on the [[Forbes 400]] list. "Barron" stated to Greenberg that "[m]ost of the assets [of Donald’s father Fred Trump] have been consolidated to Mr. [Donald] Trump." In April 2018, Greenberg retrieved and made public the original audio recordings of his exchange with "Barron", and stated that "Trump, through this [Barron] sockpuppet, was telling me he owned 'in excess of 90 percent'" of Fred Trump's assets. Ultimately, Greenberg included Trump at the end of the Forbes 400 list at $100 million, one fifth of the $500 million which "Barron" was claiming as Donald Trump's net worth. According to Greenberg, Donald Trump was only ever worth just under $5 million, which was 5% of the net worth which was attributed to him by Forbes at the time and only 1% of what "Barron" was claiming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-lied-to-me-about-his-wealth-to-get-onto-the-forbes-400-here-are-the-tapes/2018/04/20/ac762b08-4287-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html|title=Perspective Trump lied to me about his wealth to get onto the Forbes 400. Here are the tapes.|last=Greenberg|first=Jonathan|date=April 20, 2018|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg has corrected the record by stating that, as revealed in court documents in proceedings years later, Donald Trump never owned any of Fred Trump's assets until 1999 after Fred's death, and even then, inheriting only his share of Fred's deceased estate, with Donald Trump's three siblings and some grandchildren beneficiaries inheriting their corresponding shares.

Also in 1984, "Barron" gave the press a positive spin on the 1984 collapse of a plan to build Trump Castle in New York.&lt;ref name="JSurico"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Surico|first=Jay|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exqkbp/remembering-john-barron-donald-trumps-spokesman-alter-ego-116|title=Remembering John Barron, Donald Trump's 'Spokesman' Alter Ego|magazine=Vice|date=November 6, 2015|access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, "Barron" urged fellow [[United States Football League]] team owners to partially reimburse Trump for a high-priced player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=United Press International|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/02/sports/trump-asks-help-in-paying-flutie.html|title=Trump Asks Help in Paying Flutie|website=The New York Times|date=April 2, 1985|access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1985, "John Baron, a vice president in the Trump Organization," announced to the press that the Trump Organization had signed an agreement to buy an unopened Hilton Hotel in Atlantic City.&lt;ref name="WSaxon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/28/nyregion/trump-buys-hilton-s-hotel-in-atlantic-city.html|title=Trump Buys Hilton's Hotel in Atlantic City|website=The New York Times|date=April 28, 1985|access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump stopped using the pseudonym after he was compelled to [[testify]] in court proceedings that “John Barron” was one of his pseudonyms. ''The Washington Post'' suggested that Trump might have used the pseudonym longer if not for the “lawsuit in which he testified, under oath in 1990, that 'I believe on occasion I used that name.'"&lt;ref name=Borchers/&gt;

=="John Miller" (1991)==
In 1991, a reporter for ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' attempted to interview Trump about the end of his marriage to [[Ivana Trump|Ivana]] and his rumored association with other women. She was called back by a publicist who gave his name as "John Miller", who gave her a long interview about Trump's marital affairs ("He's a good guy, and he's not going to hurt anybody. . . . He treated his wife well and . . . he will treat Marla well."), his attractiveness to women, and his wealth. The reporter thought at the time that "Miller" sounded remarkably like Trump, and played the tape to several people who knew Trump and agreed it was Trump.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html|title=Donald Trump masqueraded as publicist to brag about himself|last1=Fisher|first1=Marc|last2=Hobson|first2= Will|date=May 13, 2016|work=Washington Post|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She says Trump later told her it was a "joke gone awry".&lt;ref name="Kimble"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimble|first=Lindsay|title=Donald Trump Admitted to Posing as His Own Spokesperson to PEOPLE in 1991, Despite New Denials|url=https://people.com/celebrity/trump-previously-said-posing-as-his-own-spokesperson-was-a-joke-gone-awry/|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 15, 2016|access-date=May 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump denied that he posed as John Miller to tell ''People'', "[[Madonna (entertainer)|[Madonna]]] called and wanted to go out with him, that I can tell you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/magazine/madonna-madame-x.html|title=Madonna at Sixty|first=Vanessa|last=Grigoriadis|date=June 5, 2019|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' obtained a copy of the tape and reported that it was Trump using a pseudonym. Trump denied it, saying "It was not me on the phone." Later, when a reporter asked Trump if he had ever employed a spokesperson named John Miller, he hung up.&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/13/politics/donald-trump-recording-john-miller-barron-fake-press/|title=Donald Trump on recording: Not me|last1=Kopan|first1=Tal|last2=Diamond|first2=Jeremy|date=May 14, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Carolin Gallego" (1992)==
A 1992 letter to ''New York Magazine'' signed by "Carolin Gallego" replied to an article by Julie Baumgold. The letter asserted that "as his secretary" she knew Trump to treat women with respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Read Letters to New York From Spike Lee, Mimi Sheraton, and Donald Trump  |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/10/read-letters-to-new-york-from-spike-lee-and-donald-trump.html |date=October 24, 2017 |website=New York Magazine |language=en |access-date=January 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This letter resurfaced in a 2017 article in the ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' which highlighted similarities between patterns of repetition in Trump's speech and the final line in the letter, which read: "I do not believe any man in America gets more calls from women wanting to see him, meet him, or go out with him. The most beautiful women, the most successful women—all women love Donald Trump." The ''Washingtonian'' was unable to find any record of a Carolin Gallego as secretary to Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Abbey |last=Gingras |title=Carolin Gallego Wrote a 1992 Letter Saying Women Love Donald Trump.

=="David Dennison" (2016)==
The name "David Dennison" was used as a pseudonym for Trump by his personal lawyer [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]] in a 2016 pre-election [[non-disclosure agreement]] with [[pornographic film]] actress [[Stormy Daniels]] (born Stephanie Gregory Clifford and identified in the document as Peggy Peterson) regarding her allegation that she and Trump had [[Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal|an extramarital affair]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[NBC News]] |first=Sarah |last=Fitzpatrick |date=March 6, 2018 |title=Stormy Daniels sues Trump, says 'hush agreement' invalid because he never signed

A later legal representative of Daniels, [[Michael Avenatti]], later claimed that Davidson was a [[double agent]] all along working for Trump and Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.in/Stormy-Daniels-lawyer-Michael-Avenatti-has-turned-up-the-heat-on-another-target-his-clients-first-lawyer/articleshow/64246388.cms|title=Stormy Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti has turned up the heat on another target - his client's first lawyer|last=Smith|first=Allan|date=May 20, 2018|publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same pseudonyms were also later used in a similar 2016 pre-election agreement involving payment for the silence of [[Playboy]] [[Playmate]] model [[Shera Bechard]] about an alleged extramarital affair, with a consequent pregnancy and subsequent abortion, between "Dennison" and "Peterson". That agreement was also drafted by Trump's personal lawyer Cohen, while Bechard was also represented by the same Keith Davidson who had negotiated Stormy Daniels’ agreement with Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-negotiated-1-6-million-settlement-for-top-republican-fundraiser-1523638726|title=Trump Lawyer Michael Cohen Negotiated $1.6 Million Settlement for Top Republican Fundraiser|last1=Palazzolo|first1=Joe|last2=Rothfeld|first2=Michael|date=April 13, 2018|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bechard's case, sources identified "Dennison" as Republican fundraiser [[Elliott Broidy]], who then acknowledged in an ambiguously worded statement that he had a “relationship” (the nature of which was not specified) and that he made the $1.6 million payment to her after being made aware of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/elliott-broidy-michael-cohen-payment-playboy-playmate|title=A Top GOP Official Admitted He Had An Affair With A Playboy Model And Gave Her Money To Terminate Her Pregnancy|last=Nashrulla|first=Tasreem|date=April 13, 2018|work=Buzzfeed|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrasing of his statement also omitted any assertion that he was in fact the father of the unborn child.

==In popular culture==
Cartoonist [[Ruben Bolling]] occasionally satirizes Trump's use of John Barron in comics titled ''Donald and John: A Boy and His Imaginary Publicist''. It is drawn as a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the comic strip ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', about a boy with a rich fantasy life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comics image |title=Donald and John, a Boy and His Imaginary Publicist |url=https://boingboing.net/2016/05/17/tom-the-dancing-bug-donald-a.html |site=[https://boingboing.net/author/ruben_bolling  BoingBoing] |date=May 17, 2016 |accessdate=March 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comics image |title=A Calvinesque and Hobbesian look at "Go Back to Where You Came From" |url=https://boingboing.net/2019/07/24/a-calvinesque-and-hobbesian-lo-6.html |site=[https://boingboing.net/author/ruben_bolling  BoingBoing] |date=July 24, 2019 |accessdate=July 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season 3, episode 5 of ''[[The Good Fight]]'' that airs on [[CBS All Access]] a character places a fake call to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' using the name John Barron. This is followed by a musical interlude written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] and animated by Steve Angel explaining Trump’s use of the alias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Legend of John Barron |series=The Good Fight |URL=https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/t/the-good-fight-short-the-legend-of-john-barron/vp-BBVSFZZ |season=3 |number=5 }} the animated explanation of John Barron.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donald J. Trump State Park''' is a {{convert|436|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[state park]] located within the towns of [[Yorktown, New York|Yorktown]] and [[Putnam Valley, New York|Putnam Valley]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

The park consists of undeveloped property that was donated to New York State in 2006 by developer and future President [[Donald J. Trump]]. Maintenance of the park was halted in 2010 due to budget constraints, and the park remains largely undeveloped as of 2015. Most of the buildings have been demolished, only a few foundations and the existing tennis court remain {{as of|2017|lc=on}}.

== History ==
Trump purchased the property for $2 million in the 1990s, and donated it in 2006&lt;ref name=Pataki_Release/&gt;&lt;ref name=Today_Trump&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.today.com/id/12387111 |title=Spend a lovely day in... Trump State Park |website=Today.com |date=April 19, 2006 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after he was unable to gain town approvals to develop a private golf course on the property.&lt;ref name=NYT_closing&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump State Park Fired.

He used the donation as a [[tax write-off]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/274545/donald-trumps-shitty-100-million-tax-break-park/ |title=I went to Donald Trump's shitty $100 million tax break park |last=Peck  |first=Jamie |date=December 21, 2015 |website=DeathandTaxes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsmax_signs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newsmax.com/Headline/donald-trump-state-park-signs-vacant-land/2015/08/10/id/669393/ |title=Donald J.

New York State announced the park's closure due to budget cuts in February 2010.&lt;ref name=NYSP_closures&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parks.ny.gov/newsroom/press-releases/release.aspx?r=776 |title=Statements from Governor David A. Paterson and Commissioner Carol Ash on Parks Budget Cuts |website=NYS Parks, Recreation &amp; Historic Preservation |date=February 19, 2010 |author= |accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was questioned whether the closure was necessary since the operating budget for the park was only $2,500 a year and it was maintained by workers from the nearby [[Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park]].&lt;ref name=NYT_closing/&gt; Although Trump threatened to take the parkland back after the closure was announced,&lt;ref name=NYT_closing/&gt; his attempt was unsuccessful and the land remained in the control of the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref name=Crains&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150731/BLOGS02/150729822/the-charities-donald-trump-gave-money-to-and-what-it-says-about-his-candidacy |title=The charities Donald Trump gave money to and what it says about his candidacy |website=Crain's New York Business |date=July 31, 2015 |author=Elstein, Aaron |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to convert a portion of the park's French Hill section for use as a dog park in 2010 revealed that at least one of the park's abandoned buildings contained asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patch.com/new-york/yorktown-somers/town-board-discusses-trump-parks-dog-park |title=Town Board Discusses Trump Park's Dog Park |author=Pesheva, Plamena |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the planned dog park remained on hold due to difficulties raising funds for fences and [[asbestos abatement]].&lt;ref name=Dogpark_2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yorktown.dailyvoice.com/politics/yorktown-dog-park-advocates-peeved-obstacles |title=Yorktown Dog Park Advocates Peeved With Obstacles |website=Yorktown Daily Voice |date=July 7, 2012 |author= |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, website ''[[The A.V.

== Attempts to rename ==
In late 2015, State Senator [[Daniel Squadron]] introduced an "Anything But Trump Act" to change the park's name.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_nameChange"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/12059218/Calls-to-rename-Donald-Trump-state-park-in-New-York.html|title=Calls to rename Donald Trump state park in New York|author=Millward, David|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=December 18, 2015|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several suggestions for a name change were offered by elected officials. Assemblyman [[Charles D. Lavine]] suggested that the park be named for [[Peter Salem]], an African American who served in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and is thought by some historians to have been Muslim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pols-introduce-act-remove-trump-state-park-article-1.2469133|title=New York lawmakers introduce 'Anything But Trump Act' to strip Donald Trump's name from undeveloped state park|last1=Edelman|first1=Adam|date=December 17, 2015|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the district's [[U.S. Representative]] [[Sean Patrick Maloney]] suggested that the park be named after folk singer [[Pete Seeger]].&lt;ref name="NYT_nameChange"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/nyregion/demands-to-rename-donald-j-trump-state-park-gain-ground.html|title=Demands to Rename Donald J. Trump State Park Gain Ground|author=Foderaro, Lisa W.|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=December 18, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Trump suggested that New York State return the park's land to his ownership.&lt;ref name="LoHud_nameChange"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/politics-on-the-hudson/2015/12/18/trump-state-park-fight-if-they-want-they-can-give-me-land-back/77587584/|title=Trump on state park fight: "If they want, they can give me the land back"|author=Spector, Joseph|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=December 18, 2015|newspaper=The Journal News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to rename the park after Peter Seeger continued in early 2016 with a petition by activist group "People for the Pete Seeger State Park" on [[Change.org]].&lt;ref name="People for the Pete Seeger State Park"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grist.org/politics/a-movement-to-make-trump-park-great-again-by-renaming-it-for-pete-seeger|title=A movement to make Trump Park great again — by renaming it for Pete Seeger|author=Adler, Ben|date=February 5, 2016|accessdate=September 28, 2016|magazine=Grist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, New York's 25th Assembly District Representative [[Nily Rozic]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], suggested renaming the park in honor of Heather Heyer, who died in the [[Charlottesville car attack]] protesting the [[Unite the Right rally]] in Charlottesville, Virginia. No renaming of the park has been undertaken and the proposal was largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/06/new-york-lawmaker-aims-to-rename-trump-park-for-charlottesville-victim-heather-heyer.html|title=New York lawmaker aims to rename Trump park for Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer|website=Fox News|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rozic, along with New York State Senator [[Brad Hoylman]], reintroduced legislation to rename the park in 2018 but it did not make it out of committee. They again introduced legislation in 2019 to rename the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/State-Lawmakers-Again-Trying-to-Remove-Trump-Name-From-Park--504015121.html|title=State Lawmakers Again Trying to Remove Trump Name From Park|website=NBC New York|language=en|access-date=2019-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The park is subdivided into two sections, the {{convert|282|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} Indian Hill parcel in northern Jefferson Valley (part of the Town of Yorktown in Westchester County) and Putnam Valley (Putnam County), and the {{convert|154|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} French Hill parcel in southern Yorktown Heights, fully within the Town of Yorktown. The parkland features a mix of continuous forest, open meadows, and several large wetlands. Headwaters for two streams, French Hill Brook and Dogwood Creek, are located within the French Hill section of the park.&lt;ref name=Pataki_Release&gt;{{cite web|title=Governor Pataki and Donald Trump Announce Land Gift|url=http://www.ny.gov/governor/press/06/0419061.html|website=New York State Governor's Press Releases|accessdate=April 14, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209105048/http://www.ny.gov/governor/press/06/0419061.html|archivedate=December 9, 2006|date=April 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Trump began purchasing properties along the Atlantic City boardwalk in the early 1980s and received a casino license from the [[New Jersey Casino Control Commission]] (CCC) on March 15, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Trump, Donald and Schwartz, Tony, '''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ye6e_VxM00kC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=March+15,+1982,+trump&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6XqTkqINzl&amp;sig=u2IAZz7oTsgVDdcPJgnsIVhplG8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dAa7TdeSFpS-tgem26TdBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Trump: the art of the deal]''', Random House Digital, Inc., 2004, page 204&lt;/ref&gt; He had planned to build his own casino on the boardwalk, but was stalled on the project when Mike Rose, then CEO of [[Holiday Inn]] and [[Harrah's]] approached him to manage construction of a Holiday Inn Casino-Hotel. It opened in May 1984 and two years later Trump bought out Holiday Inn's shares in the property and renamed it the [[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Gwenda, '''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PmrwtRTQ3fMC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;dq=trump,+%22mike+rose%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RKbhq2cdaE&amp;sig=EyNYOx049y-LWxqVEdYtLV4TRxw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Pw27TbN1iumBB9WiyN0G&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=trump%2C%20%22mike%20rose%22&amp;f=false The Trumps: Three Generations That Built an Empire]'', Simon and Schuster, 2001, page 345 [[The Trumps: Three Generations That Built an Empire]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Trump purchased the nearly-complete Atlantic City Hilton hotel and casino property at the Atlantic marina from [[Hilton Hotels]] for $325 million. The hotel chain sold the property after its application for a gaming license was turned down by the CCC.&lt;ref&gt;Delugach, Al, [https://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-19/business/fi-15078_1_atlantic-city-hotel Hilton Negotiating to Sell Its Atlantic City Hotel-Casino to Trump], L.A. Times, April 19, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Trump originally opened the property as Trump's Castle Hotel Casino, and later renamed it the [[Trump Marina]].

In 1988, Trump purchased the unfinished Taj Mahal property from [[Resorts International]] for $230 million after negotiations with [[Merv Griffin]] in which the two men divided the assets of the failing company.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, Nina, [https://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-24/magazine/tm-10039_1_merv-griffin/14 Merv Griffin's Outrageous Fortune...], L.A. Times, July 24, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The casino, at the time the largest in Atlantic City, would eventually cost almost $1 billion by the time it opened in 1990. Trump completed the project using [[High-yield debt|junk bonds]], a decision that hurt the company afterward as the gaming industry struggled in [[Early 1990s recession|a recession]] and interest rates became unmanageable.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Kenneth, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-04-06/news/9001280173_1_donald-trump-marla-maples-trump-taj-mahal Trump Taj Mahal Casino-hotel Opens With A Bang], Chicago Tribune, April 6, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=After his gloom went over like a lead balloon, Trump tries to sell happiness, in junk bonds | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/business/markets-market-place-after-his-gloom-went-over-like-lead-balloon-trump-tries.html |work=The New York Times | date=May 7, 2002 | accessdate=December 18, 2018 | author=Atlas, D. Riva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was shaken by the deaths of three key executives in an April 10, 1989 helicopter crash in northern New Jersey while they were returning from a New York press conference promoting an upcoming Atlantic City boxing event. The men were Steven F. Hyde, the CEO of Trump's casino operations, Mark Grossinger Etess, the president and chief operating officer of the Taj Mahal, and Trump Plaza executive vice president Jonathan Benanav.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/11/nyregion/copter-crash-kills-3-aides-of-trump.html?mcubz=0&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Trump established '''Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts''' (THCR) as a publicly traded company, granting it ownership of the Trump Plaza and the under-development [[Majestic Star II|Trump Casino]] in [[Gary, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump Plaza casino stock trades today on Big Board|newspaper=New York Times|author=Floyd Norris|date=June 7, 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/07/business/trump-plaza-casino-stock-trades-today-on-big-board.html|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, THCR bought the Trump Taj Mahal at a valuation of $890 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump moves to put Taj Mahal in his company|newspaper=New York Times|author=David Cay Johnston|date=January 9, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/09/business/trump-moves-to-put-taj-mahal-in-his-company.html|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Form 8-K: Current Report|publisher=Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc.|date=May 2, 1996|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/943320/0000950130-96-001492.txt|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bought the Trump Castle from Trump for $486 million (including $355 million in assumed debt).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump co. buying Castle|newspaper=New York Daily News|author=Douglas Feiden|date=October 1, 1996|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/trump-buying-castle-donald-130m-stock-885g-cash-article-1.737340|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the company opened [[Trump World's Fair]], a casino adjunct to the Trump Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At Trump's World's Fair opening, gamblers hope casino 13 is lucky|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|author=Amy S. Rosenberg|date=May 16, 1996|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-05-16/news/25625256_1_fourth-casino-casino-license-casino-official|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World's Fair was closed in 1999, with plans to replace it with a larger resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump closes old resort for new one in Atlantic City, N.J.|newspaper=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News|author=Patrick Jenkins|date=February 17, 2000|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59513389.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329081014/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59513389.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 29, 2015|accessdate=2014-12-15}} {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, THCR was one of eleven applicants for three casino licenses available in [[Detroit]], with a $542-million proposal for the Trump Motor City Hotel Casino, in partnership with [[Mel Farr]].&lt;ref name="reindl"&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump's 1997 bid for Detroit casino showed off campaign style|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|author=JC Reindl|date=June 21, 2016|url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2016/06/20/donald-trump-bid-detroit-casino-showed-off-campaign-style/85931570/|accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was ultimately dropped from consideration because of Mayor [[Dennis Archer]]'s doubts about the company's financial condition.&lt;ref name="reindl" /&gt;

In 1998, THCR business consultants spent at least $68,000 on a trip to [[Cuba]] in violation to the [[United States embargo against Cuba]]. According to a report by ''[[Newsweek]]'', the consulting firm Seven Arrows Investment and Development instructed THCR on how to evade the embargo by linking the money to a charitable effort.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web |last=Eichenwald |first=Kurt |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/10/14/donald-trump-cuban-embargo-castro-violated-florida-504059.html |title=Donald Trump's company violated the U.S. embargo against Cuba |work=Newsweek |date=September 29, 2016 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, THCR agreed to purchase the [[Isle of Capri Kansas City|Flamingo Hilton Casino Kansas City]] for $15 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump buying casino in KC|newspaper=Kansas City Star|author=Rick Alm|date=January 15, 1999|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EAF46B10E72859D&amp;rft_id=info%3Asid%2Finfoweb.newsbank.com&amp;rft_val_format=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;svc_dat=AWNB&amp;req_dat=1028A39C75C2B899|via=NewsBank}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the deal fell through when Missouri gaming regulators did not approve the company's gaming license by a contractual deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KC Flamingo to be bought by Station|newspaper=Kansas City Star|author=Rick Alm|date=September 14, 1999|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EAF477F16FA846B&amp;rft_id=info%3Asid%2Finfoweb.newsbank.com&amp;rft_val_format=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;svc_dat=AWNB&amp;req_dat=1028A39C75C2B899|via=NewsBank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

THCR entered a management agreement in 2000 to operate the [[Spotlight 29 Casino]], an [[Indian casino]] in [[Coachella, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palm Springs tribe, Trump sign casino deal|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author1=Tom Gorman|author2=Dan Morain|date=March 9, 2000|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/09/news/mn-6942|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial troubles===
Trump Entertainment Resorts and its predecessors have filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] four times, in 1991, following construction of the $1-billion Trump Taj Mahal, and in 2004, 2009 and 2014.

In 2004, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts explored various options for restructuring its debt, amid speculation that it might file for bankruptcy. A possible arrangement with [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] was not completed because the bondholders rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/trump-bets-new-debt-deal-345m-csfb-rescue-plan-crumbles-article-1.563901 |title=Trump Hotels says deal with Credit Suisse First Boston is dead |work=Daily News |author= Lore Croghan |date=September 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2004, the company announced a preliminary agreement with its investors. Trump, who had been the majority owner, would reduce his stock ownership from 56 to 27 percent. Bondholders would surrender some of their debt in exchange for stock. On October 27, the company announced that [[Morgan Stanley]] would be the joint lead arranger for a $500 million financing as part of the restructuring plan. On November 21, the company filed for bankruptcy. Trump said the filing was "really just a technical thing" as the best way to implement the restructuring plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/6556470 |title=Trump casinos file for bankruptcy; 'Apprentice' star's firm seeks protection from creditors |work=Associated Press |date=November 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was submitted to the [[bankruptcy court]] on December 16, 2004.

After the 2004 bankruptcy, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts changed its name to Trump Entertainment Resorts (TER).

In 2005, the company's involvement in the Spotlight 29 Casino ended, as the tribe bought out the casino management agreement for $6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Casino reannointed 'Spotlight 29' in Trump-deal buyout|newspaper=The Public Record|location=Palm Springs, CA|author=Rick Davis|date=February 15, 2005|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-796885631.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329081012/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-796885631.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 29, 2015}} {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, TER sold its Indiana casino to [[The Majestic Star Casino, LLC]] for $253 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump to sell Gary casino to Majestic Star for $253 million|newspaper=The Times of Northwest Indiana|date=November 4, 2005|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/trump-to-sell-gary-casino-to-majestic-star-for-million/article_585fc7eb-80db-5d01-a6d2-476641ad9f8f.html|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Trump Entertainment Resorts completes sale of Trump Indiana riverboat to Majestic Star|publisher=Trump Entertainment Resorts|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/943320/000090951805000995/mv12-22ex99_1.txt|date=December 21, 2005|via=EDGAR|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had also been awarded a license to build a second casino in [[Orange County, Indiana]], but dropped this plan, due in part to the state's concerns about the company's viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump drops plans for Orange County casino|newspaper=WIBC-FM|date=March 2, 2005|url=http://www.wibc.com/blogs/trump-drops-plans-orange-county-casino|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the company attempted to negotiate a [[buyout]] with several public and private firms, but on July 2, it announced that it could not reach a deal, and would take itself off the market. The company planned to lay off employees in order to cut costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/trump-entertainment-shares-plummet-no/story.aspx?guid=%7B94B3DE7D%2D5F9C%2D4F6B%2D87AE%2D43EC0A68CC1A%7D&amp;siteid=yhoof |publisher=MarketWatch |title=No Trump Entertainment deal; shares plunge |author=William Spain|date=July 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 bankruptcy and restructuring===
The casino group filed for bankruptcy again in February 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump Entertainment Resorts Chapter 11 Petition|url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/UIAP7CQ/Trump_Entertainment_Resorts,_Inc.__njbke-09-13655__0001.0.pdf|website=PacerMonitor|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Love, Zach, [http://www.law.com/jsp/tal/PubArticleTAL.jsp?id=1202428342063 Bankruptcy Roundup: Trump Dumps Casinos, Fortunoff Gets Sued, and Peanut Corp. Goes Under], Law.Com, Feb. 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; owing $1.2 billion. Two sets of debt holders eventually proposed reorganization plans for the group in U.S. bankruptcy court.

Trump initially made an agreement with banker and poker player [[Andrew Beal]], owner of [[Beal Bank]], which held $500 million in the group's debt, to take over the resorts. However, citing concerns about the bank's lack of gaming experience, he dropped them in favor of hedge fund [[Avenue Capital Management]], a plan favored by other bondholders. Beal then partnered with investor, [[Carl Icahn]], who had worked on restructuring another Atlantic City casino, the [[Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City|Tropicana]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Peter, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704467804574589771542215910 Icahn Leaps Into Trump Casino Battle], Wall Street Journal, Dec. 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In court, Trump argued that he would fight the Icahn/Beal team if they sought to use his name and likeness on the group's properties.&lt;ref&gt;Church, Steven, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aCuQLtkCp0js Trump Argues Name Can't Be Used By Icahn for Casinos (Update4)], Bloomberg, February 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he signed an agreement with Avenue Capital in which he would receive 5% stock in the reorganized company and another 5% in exchange for the use of his name and likeness in perpetuity.

The bankruptcy court eventually sided with the Trump/Avenue partnership, favored by bond holders who believed that Trump's brand would result in a stronger company after reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Mary Pat, [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202473063287&amp;rss=newswire&amp;slreturn=1&amp;hbxlogin=1 Trump-Icahn Bankruptcy Pact OK'd but Bondholders' Legal Fees Unresolved], Law.Com, Oct. 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, TER sold the [[Trump Marina]] to [[Landry's Restaurants]], which also operates the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/trump_to_sell_atlantic_city_ma.html Trump Entertainment to sell Atlantic City Marina Hotel for $38M], Star-Ledger, Feb. 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post 2009 bankruptcy===
In February 2013, the company agreed to sell the Trump Plaza for $20 million to the [[Meruelo Group]], a California-based company whose holdings include the [[Grand Sierra Resort]] in [[Reno, Nevada]]. The proceeds would be used to pay down the company's debt to a level of $270 million. CEO Robert Griffin said TER would consider also selling the Trump Taj Mahal for the right price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atlantic City's Trump Plaza goes for bargain $20M|newspaper=Miami Herald|agency=AP|author=Wayne Parry|date=February 14, 2013|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/02/14/3234803/apnewsbreak-acs-trump-plaza-sold.html|accessdate=2013-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carl Icahn, who held the mortgage on the Trump casinos, would reject the sale of the Trump Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/press/atlantic_city/carl-icahn-won-t-approve-sale-of-trump-plaza-for/article_6bf05244-abb4-11e2-97a7-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Carl Icahn won't approve sale of Trump Plaza for $20M|work=Press of Atlantic City|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August 2014, Donald Trump filed a lawsuit demanding removal of his name from the company's two casinos, because they had allegedly been allowed to fall into disrepair, in breach of the licensing agreement for Trump's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parry|first1=Wayne|title=Trump: Plaza and Taj Mahal too shabby to bear his name anymore|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20140806_Trump__Plaza_and_Taj_Mahal_casinos_too_shabby_to_bear_his_name_anymore.html|website=philly.com|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case was significant as it was a matter of [[first impression (law)|First impression]] among the courts of appeal and could significantly alter the balance of power between debtor-employers and their unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salzberg|first1=Mark A.|title=Trump (Entertainment) Wins!

==Folding of the company==
On October 10, 2016 the Trump Taj Mahal, the company's last operating property, closed for the final time. Trump Entertainment will remain operating to deal with the transfer of some points on the Trump One card account.&lt;ref&gt;there is only ''This site is currently under maintenance'', retrieved June 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the websites related to the company redirect to DonaldJTrump.com. Trump Plaza is still owned by the company, and has been vacant since its closure in September 2014. The Plaza has been liquidated of its assets in rumor of implosion. On December 14, 2018, the demolition deadline officially passed, meaning Trump Plaza will remain standing through the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/press/casinos_tourism/no-word-on-future-of-trump-plaza-as-another-demolition/article_3533e20b-ec5c-5cf6-8068-ca5e9b5114ba.html|title=No word on future of Trump Plaza as another demolition deadline passes|last=Writer|first=DAVID DANZIS Staff|website=Press of Atlantic City|language=en|access-date=2019-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late December 2018, Carl Icahn, the owner of Icahn Enterprises which owns Trump Entertainment Resorts, terminated the deed restriction on the property, and bought out a complicated lease. This is important as it makes a sale much more attractive.

==Former properties==
The company's former properties include:
*[[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino|Harrah's at Trump Plaza]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey (formerly a 50/50 partnership with [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation|Harrah's]]) now wholly owned and renamed as the [[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino|Trump Plaza]], which was closed on September 16, 2014.
*[[Spotlight 29 Casino|Trump 29 Casino]] in [[Coachella, California]] (formerly a 50/50 partnership with the [[Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians of California]]) 2006 Trump officially got out. Now [[Spotlight 29 Casino]].
*[[Majestic Star II|Trump Casino]] in [[Gary, Indiana]] now the [[Majestic Star II]].
* [[Trump World's Fair]] at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Operated as a wing of Trump Plaza, but with its own casino license, it was closed in 1999, and demolished in 2000.
* [[Trump Castle]] (renamed [[Trump Marina]] in 1997) in Atlantic City, New Jersey, sold to [[Landry's, Inc.]] in 2011 and renamed the [[Golden Nugget Atlantic City]] 
* [[Steel Pier]], sold in 2011
* [[Trump Taj Mahal]], a casino resort on the Atlantic City boardwalk; closed on October 10, 2016; purchased by [[Hard Rock Cafe|Hard Rock International]] and reopened as the [[Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City]] in June 2018

Several '''magazines named after [[Donald Trump]]''' were published between 1997 and 2009. '''''Trump Style''''', launched in February 1997, was available for free to VIP guests at [[Trump Entertainment Resorts|Trump's hotel-casino properties]], and was also available to residents of Trump's condominium buildings and members of his [[Mar-a-Lago]] club.

A new magazine known as '''''Trump World''''', initially pitched to Trump by Michael Jacobson, was launched in November 2002, as a replacement for ''Trump Style''. Because of a dispute between Jacobson and the magazine's publishing company, ''Trump World'' was discontinued after its second issue was printed in May 2003.

''Trump World'' was relaunched in September 2004, and was renamed as '''''Trump Magazine''''' in March 2006. A special edition for the New York City area was launched later that year. A new version of ''Trump Magazine'' was launched in November 2007; the publication ended in May 2009, due to poor advertising sales as a result of the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]].

==History==
===''Trump Style'' (1997–2002)===
In October 1996, [[Donald Trump]] announced plans for ''Trump Style'', a magazine to be distributed at his condo and hotel properties beginning in early 1997. The magazine was to be published by [[the New York Times Company]]'s custom-publishing division, with 100,000 copies to be distributed on two separate occasions in 1997. Trump planned to switch the magazine to a quarterly publication in 1998. The premiere issue was to include fashion and food information, as well as [[horoscope]]s, a story about Italy's [[Amalfi Coast]], and the latest information regarding Trump's casino games and shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Karen|title=Pageants, 'Style' in Trump's cards|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/|accessdate=May 30, 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 24, 1996|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Trump Style'' was launched by New York Times Custom Publishing in February 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Donald....|url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/the-donald-115468|accessdate=May 30, 2017|work=Casino City Times|date=February 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine had a circulation of 130,000, and was available for free to VIP guests who stayed at [[Trump Entertainment Resorts|Trump's hotel-casino properties]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Match&gt;{{cite news|last=Huhn|first=Mary|title=Style Without Substance – Ivana vs. Donald in Match of Egos|url=https://nypost.com/1999/02/17/style-without-substance-ivana-vs-donald-in-match-of-egos/|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=[[New York Post]]|date=February 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDN-2016/&gt; ''Trump Style'' was also available to residents of Trump's five Trump-branded condominium buildings in New York, and to members of his [[Mar-a-Lago]] club in Florida.&lt;ref name=Free&gt;{{cite news|last=DeAngelis|first=Martin|title=Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, from an Expert|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/|accessdate=May 30, 2017|work=[[The Press of Atlantic City]]|date=March 16, 1997|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere issue contained 68 color pages made of heavyweight paper, and was arranged into several sections: Trump News, providing information on Trump's new [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (New York City)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in Manhattan; Trump Scene, featuring six pictures of famous visitors to Mar-a-Lago, including multiple pictures of Trump and his wife [[Marla Maples]]; Casino News, offering information about Trump's casinos; and horoscopes written by [[Athena Starwoman]]. Other sections included Wines and Spirits, and Trends.&lt;ref name=Free/&gt; Martin DeAngelis of ''[[The Press of Atlantic City]]'' wrote a positive review of ''Trump Style'', and noted that the magazine "is, tragically, not on sale - anywhere."&lt;ref name=Free/&gt;

===''Trump World'' (2002–2003)===
Michael Jacobson, who was involved with Lockwood Publications,&lt;ref name=NYPost/&gt; stayed in a suite at the [[Golden Nugget Atlantic City|Trump Marina]] hotel-casino in Atlantic City at the end of 2001. Jacobson conceived the idea for a Trump-branded magazine after noticing that his suite offered no magazines to read. Jacobson met Trump shortly thereafter and the two agreed to start a magazine that would be named after Trump.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

On November 14, 2002, at the World Bar inside [[Trump World Tower]] in New York, Trump unveiled plans to replace ''Trump Style'' with a new magazine to be known as ''Trump World''. Jacobson expected to spend under $1 million to launch the new magazine, which would be published quarterly. A total of 50,000 copies would be offered to guests for free at Trump's country clubs, condominium properties, and hotel-casinos, while another 50,000 would be mailed to upper-class people. Trump, who would not be spending any money on the magazine, would still earn a portion of the profits. Trump said, "I have editorial control, but I also have a tremendous lack of time. I'm not going to be checking commas. I'm not going to be very involved." The magazine's [[editor-in-chief]] was Alyson Boxman Levine.&lt;ref name=NYPost/&gt; [[Charlotte Ross]] appeared on the cover of the new magazine.&lt;ref name=NYPost&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Keith J.|title=Trump, the Magazine: The Donald Launches Luxury Lifestyle Quarterly|url=https://nypost.com/2002/11/14/trump-the-magazine-the-donald-launches-luxury-lifestyle-quarterly/|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=New York Post|date=November 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the second issue was published in May 2003, Lockwood Publications ended its publication of ''Trump World'' because of a dispute between Jacobson and Lockwood. Jacobson had wanted to turn ''Trump World'' into a paid-circulation magazine and increase its distribution, an idea that Lockwood rejected. Lockwood had already done so for another magazine that it published {{ndash}} known as ''Smoke'' {{ndash}} and was reluctant to do the same for another one of its magazines. Lockwood sold ''Trump World'' to Jacobson for less than $100,000.&lt;ref name=NYPost-Sep2004/&gt;

===''Trump World'' revival (2004–2006)===
In June 2004, Trump announced plans for a redesigned version of ''Trump World'' that would be sold to the public as a bimonthly magazine, with an initial printing of 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Peter|title=It's Trump's 'World'; we're just living in it|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-06-28-trump-magazine_x.htm|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 28, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307040514/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-06-28-trump-magazine_x.htm|archivedate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDN-Jun2004&gt;{{cite news|last=Groves|first=Lloyd|title=Trump Fires Up the Presses|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/trump-fires-presses-article-1.635539|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=New York Daily News|date=June 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump Will Launch Magazine|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/01/business/fi-rup1.6|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson would serve as the editor and publisher of a new company known as Sobe Life LLC, which had more than $1 million in financial support from Lee Fry,&lt;ref name=NYPost-Sep2004/&gt; a Chicago entrepreneur who would serve as the magazine's primary financial backer and as [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of Sobe Life.&lt;ref name=NYDN-Jun2004/&gt; Jacobson said the new magazine would be distributed to approximately 50,000 rooms located at Trump's properties,&lt;ref name=NYPost-Sep2004/&gt; and would be offered for free to guests,&lt;ref name=August1/&gt; while an additional 150,000 would be for sale nationally.&lt;ref name=NYPost-Sep2004&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Keith J.|title=Makeover at Trump World – Startup Company Selling The Donald for $29.99 a Year|url=https://nypost.com/2004/09/08/makeover-at-trump-world-startup-company-selling-the-donald-for-29-99-a-year/|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=New York Post|date=September 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine would be targeted at people between the ages of 21 and 55, and would focus on diverse topics including arts and entertainment, food and wine, travel, and real estate, as well as successful business stories, and information about [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 2)|the second season]] of Trump's [[reality television]] series, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref name=NYDN-Jun2004/&gt; Jacobson, who believed that the success of ''The Apprentice'' would help sales of the new ''Trump World'', said that 30 percent of the magazine would focus on Trump's properties.&lt;ref name=NYPost-Sep2004/&gt;

''Trump World'' went on sale in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Traub|first=James|title=Trumpologies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/12/magazine/trumpologies.html|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=September 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model [[Caprice Bourret]] appeared on the cover of the first issue.&lt;ref name=August1&gt;{{cite news|last=Dash|first=Eric|title=Trump-isms, For Only $5.95|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/01/business/openers-suits-trump-isms-for-only-5.95.html?_r=0|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2005, the magazine had lost more than $3 million and was largely considered to be a failure. However, as part of a licensing agreement, Trump earned $120,000 for each issue published that year.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Beginning in 2006, Trump received a [[Royalty payment|royalty fee]] of $135,000 for each issue, and was to continue receiving royalty fees through 2009. Trump also had the right to read and approve each issue at least 10 days prior to its publication.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

===''Trump Magazine'' (2006–2009)===
In March 2006,&lt;ref name=NYP-2006&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Keith J.|title=Trump Mag Publisher to Make OTC Play|url=https://nypost.com/2006/07/27/trump-mag-publisher-to-make-otc-play/|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=New York Post|date=July 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson renamed the magazine as ''Trump Magazine'' and began marketing it towards men. Jacobson changed the magazine to focus on Trump's lifestyle and personality, and also placed Trump on the cover of the spring 2006 issue.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYP-March/&gt;  The changes were successful, with the spring issue earning approximately $250,000.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Trump's daughter, model [[Ivanka Trump]], appeared on the summer 2006 cover of the revamped magazine to help attract male readers.&lt;ref name=NYP-2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYP-March&gt;{{cite news|last=Groves|first=Lloyd|title=In Divorce Saga, Ron Has the Last Word|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/divorce-saga-ron-word-article-1.654231|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=New York Post|date=March 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, a New York City edition of ''Trump Magazine'' was launched and sold out within 30 days. At that time, ''Trump World'' had a circulation of 207,000, a quarter of which was distributed to Trump's properties. That month, plans were announced to launch a [[south Florida]] edition in February 2007.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneiderman|first=R.M.|title=Trump Launches South Florida Magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/10/06/donald-trump-magazine-cx_rs_1006autofacescan06.html|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean Drive Media Group announced plans for a new ''Trump Magazine'' in September 2007, with the first issue scheduled for launch in November 2007. The new magazine would be published quarterly, with wider distribution than the previous version of ''Trump Magazine''. The initial printing would consist of 100,000 copies, which would be distributed for free at Trump properties and would also be sold in several cities where the properties were located. Glen Albin would serve as the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pérez-Peña|first=Richard|title=If You Have Money, Trump Knows How to Use It|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/business/25trump.html?ex=1348372800&amp;en=b457f8de010e2e57&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=April 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Morgan Lewis was founded in Philadelphia on March 10, 1873, by Civil War veteran [[Charles Eldridge Morgan, Jr.]], later Vice-President of the Philadelphia Law Academy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1800s/morgan_chas_e.html Philomathean Society] "Charles Eldridge Morgan (1844 - 1917)," PENN BIOGRAPHIES, PENN University Libraries and Records Center, Philomathean Society, University of Pennsylvania.

Polhemus Printing Company, New York, USA, 1892. Retrieved May 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1896, became Dean of the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].

In 1883, Morgan &amp; Lewis hired Morris Rex Bockius, who had graduated in June of that year with Master of Arts and Bachelor of Law degrees from the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upl/upl1/upl1_1883_84.pdf ''U of Pennsylvania] "Catalogue and Announcements 1883 - 1884", University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Penn., USA, 1884, page 104.

'''Trump Plaza''' is a 36-story [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] and retail building named after [[Donald Trump]] and located at 167 East [[61st Street (Manhattan)|61st Street]] in the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], New York City.&lt;ref name=Emp/&gt; The property, designed by 
[[Philip Birnbaum (architect)|Philip Birnbaum]] and built at a cost of $125 million, was opened in 1984.

==History==
===Construction===
Construction of Trump Plaza began in 1982, at the intersection of East [[61st Street (Manhattan)|61st Street]] and [[Third Avenue]].&lt;ref name=Emp&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump Plaza Apartments|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115139/trump-plaza-apartments-new-york-city-ny-usa|publisher=[[Emporis]]|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Trump]] negotiated a 40-year deal with the owner of the land in which the building would pay an annual rent of approximately $1.2 million until 2023.&lt;ref name=Rising&gt;{{cite news|last=Satow|first=Julie|title=Rising Costs a Concern for Land-Lease Building Owners|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/realestate/rising-costs-a-concern-for-land-lease-building-owners-in-new-york.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlyle|first=Erin|title=Manhattan's Trump Plaza Apartment Owners Face $1 Million Fee|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2014/11/06/manhattans-trump-plaza-apartment-owners-face-1-million-fee/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump chose to name the project Trump Plaza to capitalize on the marketing success of his nearby [[Trump Tower]]. The project, initially expected to cost $50 million, was to contain 180 [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] units, located above {{convert|12000|sqft|abbr=on}} of retail space that would be situated on the ground floor.&lt;ref name=NYT1983/&gt;

Two project offices on East 61st Street, made of [[brownstone]], were to be converted into apartments after the main structure was completed.&lt;ref name=NYT1983/&gt; Trump said that despite the popularity of condominiums in New York at that time, "I wanted to buck the trend. There are a lot of people who want to live in a cooperative. […] Many people find a co-op's exclusivity, the unity it gives a building, comforting. This exclusivity can be used negatively, but it has positive aspects as well."&lt;ref name=NYT1983/&gt; Units would range from {{convert|1200|sqft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1900|sqft|abbr=on}}, with prices between $285,000 and $1 million.&lt;ref name=NYT1983&gt;{{cite news|last=Daniels|first=Lee A.|title=About Real Estate; Upper East Side Attracts Two Mixed-Use Projects|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/07/business/about-real-estate-upper-east-side-attracts-two-mixed-use-projects.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=January 7, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales began in April 1983, with initial prices starting at $450 per square foot.&lt;ref name=NYT-Apartments/&gt; In May 1983, a construction worker died after falling 33 stories while working on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Worker Is Killed In 33-Story Fall|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/03/nyregion/the-city-worker-is-killed-in-33-story-fall.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=May 3, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1983, starting prices for apartment units in the project had increased six times, ultimately reaching up to $1,200 per square foot; 50 percent of the apartments had been leased up to that point.&lt;ref name=NYT-Apartments&gt;{{cite news|last=Wedemeyer|first=Dee|title=A Turn in the Market for New Apartments|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/03/realestate/a-turn-in-the-market-for-new-apartments.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=July 3, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost $125 million to construct.&lt;ref name=Expand/&gt;

The concrete and concrete workers union labor for the building was supplied by mobster [[Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno]] . Salerno and Trump were linked through [[Roy Cohn]], who represented both of them. In 1986 [[Rudy Giuliani]] and the SDNY indicted Salerno on racketeering linked to the [[bid rigging]] of concrete and construction on Trump Plaza, as well as other buildings built in the era.&lt;ref name="roll_TheR"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Real-Life Mob Families of 'The Irishman'?

===Opening and operation===
Trump Plaza was opened in March 1984, with 145 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oser|first=Alan S.|title=Retailers' Locations; Movement at the Alexander's Site|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/realestate/perspectives-retailers-locations-movement-at-the-alexander-s-site.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=December 15, 1985|quote=Trump Plaza, a 145-unit cooperative on the west side of the avenue between 60th and 61st Street, opened in March 1984 […].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable residents included former Kentucky governor [[John Y. Brown Jr.]] and his wife [[Phyllis George]], as well as [[Dick Clark]] and [[Martina Navratilova]].&lt;ref name=Expand&gt;{{cite news|last=Geist|first=William E.|title=The Expanding Empire of Donald Trump|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-expanding-empire-of-donald-trump.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=April 8, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of opening, Trump owned 90 percent of the building partnership.&lt;ref name=Expand/&gt; Apartment owners, under the name of Trump Plaza Owners Inc., sued Trump in February 1990, claiming the building contained various defects. The suit sought for Trump to pay $10.7 million and to have his name removed from the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Trump Co-Op Tenant Suit Cites Poor Workmanship|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[The Press of Atlantic City]]|date=February 15, 1990|url-access=subscription|via=NewsLibrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1999, Trump still owned a few apartment units, as well as retail space and the property's parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salkin|first=Allen|title=Trump: The Smarts of the Deal|url=https://nypost.com/1999/04/18/trump-the-smarts-of-the-deal-how-donald-uses-mostly-other-peoples-money-to-build-a-kingdom-in-his-name/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[New York Post]]|date=April 18, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the property is operated by [[Douglas Elliman]] Property Management.&lt;ref name=Rising/&gt; In 2016, to remain competitive with newer residential projects, Trump Plaza's basement gym facility was converted into a children's playroom, while the gym was relocated to a space on the first and second floor that was previously used as an apartment by the [[building superintendent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Joanne|title=Insert a Gym, Then a Lounge: Older Buildings Add Amenities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/realestate/older-buildings-add-amenities-to-compete.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Trump Plaza was designed by Philip Birnbaum and was built out in a Y-shape.&lt;ref name=NYT1983/&gt; The structure is made of [[limestone]], glass, and metal,&lt;ref name=Look/&gt; and includes five apartments on each floor,&lt;ref name=Defining/&gt; while the building includes a total of {{convert|340000|sqft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NYT1983/&gt; Trump, who sometimes exaggerated the number of floors in his buildings, stated that Trump Plaza was 39 stories high while it is actually 36 stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheshes|first=Jay|title=Edifice Complex: Does The Donald have a size problem?|url=http://nymag.com/news/articles/shortlist/trump/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=November 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Birnbaum was known for simple building designs in New York City, architectural critic [[Paul Goldberger]] stated that Trump Plaza "looks as if it might be the finest building in [[Caracas]] – all of this sleekness is [[chic]] in a particularly Latin way, quite uncharacteristic of New York, despite the lavish use of limestone." Goldberger also stated that no one "could possibly mistake it for yet another Third Avenue high-rise."&lt;ref name=Defining&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|title=Defining Luxury in New York's New Apartments|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/16/garden/defining-luxury-in-new-york-s-new-apartments.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=August 16, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberger later called it "a better and more striking building than the typical Third Avenue brick box, but it is nothing if not showy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|title=Trump: Symbol of a Gaudy, Impatient Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/31/arts/architecture-view-trump-symbol-of-a-gaudy-impatient-time.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=January 31, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum was subsequently hired to design a nearby high-rise condominium known as the Savoy, to be built at the opposite intersection corner diagonally across from Trump Plaza. Birnbaum gave the Savoy a similar design to Trump Plaza, as he envisioned the buildings as the gateway to upper Third Avenue. In April 1984, Trump sued Birnbaum and Morton Olshan, owner of the Savoy, for allegedly copying the design of his building. Trump sought $60 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Postings; Building Higher|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/22/realestate/postings-building-higher.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Builder Donald Trump Monday sued his former architect|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/04/30/Builder-Donald-Trump-Monday-sued-his-former-architect-and/6055452145600/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=April 30, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement was reached in October 1984, after Olshan agreed to have his building redesigned. The Savoy was still under construction at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Accord Is Reached In Trump Dispute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/10/nyregion/the-city-accord-is-reached-in-trump-dispute.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=October 10, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Look&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|title=Look-Alike Buildings: The Third Ave. Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/25/arts/critic-s-notebook-look-alike-buildings-the-third-ave-case.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=October 25, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|title=Design Consciousness Reached a New High|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/30/arts/architecture-view-design-consciousness-reached-a-new-high.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=December 30, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|title=What Next?

In 2016, [[Steve Cuozzo]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' stated that the area around Trump Plaza had been "a lost highway of tenements and boxy, bland apartment buildings" and that the project "inspired four more similarly configured towers on the avenue and lent some badly needed class to uptown east of [[Lexington Avenue]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cuozzo|first=Steve|title=How Donald Trump helped save New York City|url=https://nypost.com/2016/02/07/how-donald-trump-helped-save-new-york-city/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=New York Post|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Neopalpa donaldtrumpi''''' is a [[moth]] species of the genus ''[[Neopalpa]]'' occurring in [[Southern California]] and [[Northern Mexico]]. It was described in 2017 by [[Iranian Canadians|Iranian-Canadian]] scientist Vazrick Nazari. Known for its yellowish-white head scales being reminiscent of [[Donald Trump]]'s hair, the moth was given its name because Nazari stated that he wanted "to bring wider public attention to the need to continue protecting fragile habitats in the US that still contain many undescribed species."&lt;ref name=Samuelson&gt;{{cite news |last=Samuelson |first=Kate |date=January 18, 2017 |title=Scientists Just Named a Tiny Moth After Donald Trump: The moth's official name is Neopalpa donaldtrumpi |url=http://time.com/4637403/tiny-moth-donald-trump/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The genus ''[[Neopalpa]]'', including the species ''[[Neopalpa neonata]]'', was first described in 1998 by Dalibor Povolný.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Povolný |first=Dalibor |date=1998 |title=''Neopalpa'' gen. n. and ''Eurysaccoides'' gen. n. – two new genera of the tribe Gnorimoschemini from California, with the description of three new species (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) |journal=Revista de Lepidopterología |volume=26 |pages=139–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost two decades later, Nazari reviewed the material, including specimens that had been collected since the first description of the genus, from the [[Bohart Museum of Entomology|Bohart Entomology Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitch|first=Chris|date=January 18, 2017|title=Meet the Trump moth|url=http://geographical.co.uk/nature/wildlife/item/2099-meet-the-trump-moth|newspaper=[[Geographical (magazine)|Geographical]]|publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]]|access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered that some of the specimens formed a new species.  In January 2017 he published an article naming it ''Neopalpa donaldtrumpi'' for the yellowish-white color of the scales on the head, which reminded him of then President-elect [[Donald Trump]]'s hairstyle.&lt;ref name="Nazari"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3897/zookeys.646.11411 |pmid=28228677|pmc=5299441|title=Review of ''Neopalpa'' Povolný, 1998 with description of a new species from California and Baja California, Mexico (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae)|journal=ZooKeys |issue=646|pages=79–94 |year=2017 |last1=Nazari |first1=Vazrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/motte-neopalpa-donaldtrumpi-traegt-namen-von-donald-trump-a-1130502.html "''Neopalpa donaldtrumpi'' Motte trägt nun Namen von Donald Trump"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', January 18, 2017 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Donaldtrumpi frontal.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Head of ''N. donaldtrumpi'']] 
The upper surface of the ''N. donaldtrumpi'' forewings is orange-yellow except for dark brown patches on the fringe and anterior portions of the wing. The length between [[Insect wing|forewings]] is {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4.6|mm|in|abbr=on}}. [[Insect wing|Hindwings]] are pale buff, with dark fringes. The wings have similar coloration for both males and females. Its [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] are about two-thirds of its wingspan and its head is covered with yellowish white scales, which inspired the moth's name.&lt;ref name="Nazari" /&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel /&gt; Compared with ''[[Neopalpa neonata|N. neonata]]'', the other species in the genus, ''N. donaldtrumpi'' male [[Lepidoptera genitalia|genitalia]] structures are smaller and female genitalia possess very few small [[seta]]e.&lt;ref name="Nazari"/&gt;

==Distribution==
While the closely related ''N. neonata'' occurs throughout much of California, [[Baja California]] and Northwest Mexico, specimens of ''N. donaldtrumpi'' so far has only been found in the Northern half of Baja California and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] and [[Imperial County, California|Imperial]] counties in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name="Nazari" /&gt;

== Biology==
''Neopalpa donaldtrumpi'' belongs to the [[Gelechiidae|twirler moths]], known for their propensity to spin in circles on leaves.&lt;ref name=Burdick&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burdick |first=Alan |date=January 20, 2017 |title=The Metaphorical Meaning of a Moth Named after Trump |url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-metaphorical-meaning-of-a-moth-named-after-trump |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=January 23, 2017 |quote=The genus belongs to a wider family, Gelechiidae, the twirler moths, so called for their habit of spinning in circles on the surface of leaves.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The moth appears to be evenly distributed through the year, but its [[host plant]] and lifespan are not known.&lt;ref name=BirdGuides&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=6155 |title=Research: Recently described moth named in honour of new U.S. president |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 20, 2017 |website=BirdGuides |access-date=January 23, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its habitat is threatened by [[urbanization]].&lt;ref name=Raphael&gt;{{cite news |last=Raphael |first=John |date=January 19, 2017 |title=New Moth Species With Yellowish-White Scales, Small Genitals Named After Donald Trump |url=http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/35111/20170119/new-moth-species-yellowish-white-scales-small-genitals-named-donald.htm |newspaper=Nature World News |access-date=January 23, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trump Force One''' is an informal name for [[The Trump Organization]]'s [[private jet]], comparing it with [[Air Force One]], originally used by [[Donald Trump]]. The name was coined before Trump became [[president of the United States]] and was in use by his supporters during his presidential campaign of 2016. The current version of Trump Force One is a [[Boeing 757]], which replaced a [[Boeing 727]].&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider-2015-07-27/&gt; It is operated as part of "Trump Air", the air assets of [[The Trump Organization]].&lt;ref name=NYT-2016-04-23&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/us/politics/donald-trumps-aging-air-fleet-gives-his-bid-and-his-brand-a-lift.html |title= Donald Trump's Aging Air Fleet Gives His Bid, and His Brand, a Lift |author= Susanne Craig |date= April 23, 2016 |work= New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ-2015-09-04&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-big-boost-his-own-air-fleet-1441382605 |title= Donald Trump's Big Boost: His Own Air Fleet |date= September 4, 2015 |author= Mark Maremont; Heather Haddon |publisher= Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1981, it was converted into a business jet for [[Diamond Shamrock]]. It later operated for [[Trump Shuttle]], before being sold.

When operating as Donald Trump's private jet, the plane was configured with seating for 24, winglets, a master bedroom, bidet, dining room, galley, conference rooms, and multiple lavatories.&lt;ref name=CNNmoney-2011-11-10&gt;{{cite news |url= http://money.cnn.com/2009/11/10/news/companies/Trump_jet_sale/index.htm |title= Donald Trump to personal jet: 'You're fired!' |author= Hibah Yousuf |date= November 10, 2009 |publisher= CNN Money }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FlyingWithFish-2009-11-10&gt;{{cite news |url= http://flyingwithfish.boardingarea.com/2009/11/10/want-your-own-boeing-727-donald-trump-is-selling-hischeap/ |title= Want Your Own Boeing 727?

==Boeing 757 (2011–present)==

The Boeing 757-200 is registered in the United States as '''N757AF''' and was built in 1991. It originally was delivered to Denmark's [[Sterling Airlines]], and later, by 1993, operated by Mexico's [[TAESA]]. In 1995, it became a corporate business jet for [[Paul Allen]]'s enterprises.&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider-2015-07-27&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trumps-boeing-757-airliner-2015-7 |title= Check out 'Trump Force One' — Donald Trump's personal Boeing airliner |author= Benjamin Zhang |date= July 27, 2015 |publisher= Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MrTrump757-2011-08-18&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq3iCn2y74 |title= Mr. Trump's 757 |publisher= Donald Trump |author=  Amanda Miller |date= August 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft is equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofans, a glass cockpit, and is configured to seat 43 people. The plane is fitted with a dining room, bathroom, shower, bedroom, guest room, and galley. Many fixtures are plated in 24k gold.&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider-2015-07-27/&gt;&lt;ref name=MrTrump757-2011-08-18/&gt;

Donald Trump had planned to use the 757 for campaigning during his putative 2012 presidential bid.&lt;ref name=PalmBeachPost-2011/&gt; Trump used the 757 for transportation during his successful [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="T+L-2016-02-10"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/presidential-candidates-private-jets|title=The Private Jets Our Presidential Candidates Fly—and What They Cost|author=Melissa Locker|date=February 10, 2016|publisher=Travel+Leisure}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming President, Trump began to travel on the Boeing VC-25s commonly referred to as [[Air Force One]], although more often the [[Boeing C-32]], a newer version of the 757 that The Trump Organization owns, and similar to Trump's personal plane, is used more often.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The aircraft continues to be used by The Trump Organization for executive trips.

He said, “I think it should have been done by the military in the first term—they still have a chance to do it.”&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair" /&gt; In an interview with NBC News, Senecal stated that the US should use nuclear weapons in [[Detroit]] and [[Milwaukee]] to "bomb out" the Muslim populations there.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''The Apprentice: Martha Stewart''''' is a [[Reality television#Reality competition/game shows|reality game show]] and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the series, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', that ran in the fall of 2005. Broadcast on [[NBC]], the show featured business tycoon [[Martha Stewart]]. Tasks were centered on Stewart's areas of expertise: media, culinary arts, entertaining, decorating, crafts, design, merchandising, and style.  The tone of the show was somewhat muted compared to the original, as Stewart brought her own sensibilities to the elimination process, often simply saying goodbye, in contrast to original series host [[Donald Trump]]'s catchphrase: "You're fired." She also wrote a cordial letter to the candidate who was fired; many times she took subtle jabs at the fired candidate and gave frank reasons for why the candidate did not succeed on the show. Several segments featuring Stewart were filmed at her home in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]] because at the time, she was serving the five-month [[house arrest]] portion of her [[ImClone stock trading case|ImClone scandal]] conviction.&lt;ref name=remodel&gt;{{cite news|title=Remodeling Martha|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/11/14/8360708/index.htm|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=Fortune|date=14 November 2005|first=Patricia|last=Sellers|publisher=Time Warner Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump]], [[Mark Burnett (executive producer)|Mark Burnett]] and [[Jay Bienstock]] executive produced the show. Businessman [[Charles Koppelman]] and Stewart's daughter, [[Alexis Stewart]] accompanied the two teams during tasks and reported their observations to Stewart in the boardroom.&lt;ref name=remodel/&gt;

The two teams, Matchstick and Primarius, competed in 11 challenges. Overall, Primarius won eight, while Matchstick (candidates were reshuffled after Matchstick lost several times in a row) won only three.

The show's theme song is "[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]" by [[Eurythmics]]. The logo is a businesswoman in a dress running with a bag instead of a businessman running with a briefcase.
The background music is written by [[David Vanacore]], Mark T, Williams, and Jeff Lippencott.

Despite the fairly big initial hype, ratings for this spin-off were relatively weak. This show averaged only 7 million viewers, and garnered a mediocre 2.5 average in the very important demographic of 18- to 49-year-old viewers. However, this program aired against very tough competition, including ABC's massive hit ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. After the second episode, the show was moved from the 8 p.m. time slot to the 9 p.m. slot, and in spite of facing ''Lost'', saw a slight increase in ratings.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Trumpmartha.jpg|thumb|Martha Stewart with Donald Trump]] --&gt;

There have been numerous rumors thrown out as to why the show failed, including: "too much" Martha Stewart (her ''[[Martha (tv program)|Martha]]'' daytime program and this [[prime time]] program), confusion between this version and Trump's version which airs the day after (on Thursday nights), apathy over reality shows in general, NBC's declining fortunes, fatigue with the ''Apprentice'' franchise itself, and weak casting, although some felt the cast was superior to ''Apprentice 4'', which ran concurrently.  Trump blamed the ''Martha'' series for the declining ratings of his own version, even though the ratings for his show began to fall over a year before Martha's version premiered.  Stewart responded in turn that she was supposed to have "fired" Trump in the premiere episode, making her a successor to Trump rather than the host of a spinoff.  In mid-November 2005, NBC announced that it would not bring back the show for a second season, although the network and Stewart claimed that the show was initially planned as a one-season endeavor.

Within a few years of the end of the series, three of the top runners-up (Bethenny, Marcela, and Leslie) were participating in other television ventures, with second-place finisher [[Bethenny Frankel]] 
parlaying her fame from the inaugural cast ''[[The Real Housewives of New York City]]'' into further reality shows, television hosting, books, and a successful business, Skinnygirl Cocktails.  Fourth-place finisher Ryan Danz appeared on the [[The Amazing Race 21|21st season]] of ''[[The Amazing Race]]'' alongside his girlfriend Abbie Ginsberg. They finished in 5th place. A third contestant, Shawn Killinger, would go on to be a popular on air host at [[QVC]].

==Episodes==

===Week 1: Once Upon a Time and Dream===
*'''Airdate:''' September 21, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Random House]]
*'''Pre-task:''' After being shown to the converted loft that would serve as the candidates' accommodation, the group was instructed to divide itself into two teams of eight. Since the gender split was 10-6 in favor of the women, the teams could not be divided along gender lines as was usually done on the original show, and the candidates eventually organized themselves into a "business" team (Primarius) and a "creative" team (Matchstick).
*'''Project:''' Teams had to design and write a [[children's book]] and read it to a group of first graders.
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Dawna
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Jeff
*'''Winning team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for win:''' Their book was entertaining, age-appropriate and near-unanimously preferred by the first graders, as well as Martha and the Random House executives.
**'''Primarius's reward:''' A Japanese dinner with Martha
*'''Losing team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Though the story was fairly well-written and the illustration work was praised, the usage of rhyming verse was felt to have misfired badly, and the book was agreed to have been targeted at the wrong age range. The Random House executives said it would be more appropriate for fourth graders than first.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Jeff, Dawn, Jim
*'''Eliminated:''' Jeff, for taking over the entire project and not listening to his teammates. While Dawn was sharply criticised for bailing out of her original task of writing the book, Martha decided that since Jeff had decided to take on virtually the whole task after that happened, he deserved total blame for the loss.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "You just don't fit in."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Jeffrey, I'm sorry that you are the first to go. Not to fail, but rather, not to fully succeed. You entered this serious endeavour, knowing that someone would have to leave after the first task. Unfortunately, it is you. Personally, it is hard to make such a judgement call. But it is part of this interview process. Good luck, travel safely, it was great to meet you."''

===Week 2: Business is Blooming===
*'''Airdate:''' September 28, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had to sell flowers in high-end floral shops.
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Carrie
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Chuck
*'''Winning team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for win:''' The team hired a professional arranger to set up their shop. Despite trouble caused by the initially high prices, they ultimately managed to sell most of their stock after reducing their prices. Primarius made a profit of $1,866.
**'''Primarius's reward:''' Volunteering with New York Cares (New York City's leading volunteer organization - www.nycares.org) to create a garden for a Community Center in the Chelsea neighborhood
*'''Losing team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Their mass-marketing strategy did not pay off, and they didn't sell nearly enough flowers to have a chance of victory. While their shop was well-decorated, their promotional scheme had a terrible idea of hiring the women selling flowers not only with their Dutch tacky outfits, but they were stood in the wrong corner of the street. They only had a profit of $969.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Chuck, Jim, Dawn
*'''Eliminated:''' Chuck, for poor leadership, threatening to quit during the task, and for essentially admitting that Martha should send him home.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "I wish you good luck and good-bye."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Chuck, in a business like Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, teams work in unison toward a common goal: success. The project can be simple or complex, but the team makes it happen. There was no team-work here, and little leadership. I think you are creative, but easily flustered in a confusing situation. It is better that you leave now and concentrate on your strengths."''
*'''Special notes:'''
** After being unable to control the team early in the task, Chuck attempted to quit both as project manager and from the show itself, which caused Jim to give him a pep talk and persuade him to continue. In the initial meeting with Martha, Chuck admitted early on that he was the most at fault for the loss and probably the person who should be sent home, though he made it clear that he didn't intend to actually quit.
** There was an ugly dispute between Dawn and Jim during the task, which led to Chuck deciding to bring them into the Conference Room. Martha indicated that Bethenny and Shawn should have been brought back instead since they were responsible for the unsuccessful promotional scheme, though given Chuck's evident lack of desire to remain in the competition this may have been a deliberate choice on his part.
** Following Chuck's dismissal, Martha warned Dawn and Jim that she could have easily sent either one (or both) of them home had it not been for Chuck declining to make any argument as to why he should stay, and that she expected more of them in the future.

===Week 3: Bake It 'Til You Make It===
*'''Airdate:''' October 5, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Michael C. Fina]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had to design and sell a wedding cake.
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Howie
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' David
*'''Winning team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for win:''' Their simple but elegant design appealed to potential customers at the wedding expo, and they sold five cakes for a total profit of $3,658.
**'''Primarius's reward:''' Dinner at Jean-George with [[Donald Trump|Donald]] and [[Melania Knauss|Melania Trump]]
*'''Losing team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Their unorthodox design with pink bows and an asymmetrical shape proved very difficult to sell, and ultimately ended with the team failing to sell a single cake, and needless to say, making no money whatsoever.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' All of Matchstick. David initially wanted to bring back Dawn and Marcela, but Martha decided to override his decision and had the remaining team-members return to the Conference Room. Martha did not see Dawn as being responsible at all, and while she felt Marcela deserved some of the blame for her design decisions, she saw the sales team of Jim, Bethenny and Shawn as being more directly at fault.
*'''Eliminated:''' Shawn, for off-handed remarks, including telling Charles during the task that if they lost, she should be dismissed, and telling Martha that "fake it 'til you make it" was an important idea in the television world. Martha claimed to have worked in the television business for 12 years she never said "fake it 'til you make it". While Martha was unhappy with all three members of the sales team, she felt Shawn's attitude made her unworthy of being an executive in Martha's organization.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "I wish you well, but I'm going to have to say goodbye."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Shawn, tonight I know was difficult for you. You have a career in television, and you can develop your talent in the medium very well. You look good, you speak well, and you certainly are talkative. The culture at MSLO is very complex, and I want to express that what we do here has to be thorough, through and through. Beautiful from the inside-out, just like the wedding cake. You, as you build your career, will find your business lesson to be valid and true."''
*'''Special notes:''' 
** Jim's wife gave birth to their second child during the course of the task. Jim speaks to her over the phone several times over the two days.
** Martha expressed disappointment that the "so-called creative" team had not only lost three tasks in a row, but hadn't even come close to defeating the "business team" Primarius in any of the tasks thus far.
** Following her dismissal, Martha expressed doubts that Shawn had ever had any real interest in becoming a business executive, and felt she was more interested in the fame that would go with starring in the show.

===Week 4: Sweet Suite===
*'''Airdate:''' October 12, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Westin Hotels]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had to create a fantasy suite in a Westin Hotel. 
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Amanda
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Leslie
*'''Winning team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for win:''' While the deciding factor was ultimately Matchstick's failure to finish their own room, the Westin executives and the focus group really liked the touches in Primarius's suite.
**'''Primarius's reward:''' Enjoying the hotel suite that they had finished, with a surprise visit from Martha.
*'''Losing team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for loss:''' The executives really liked their theme, but in the end, it was an unfinished room. Most of the furniture arrived in time, but their sofas never showed up, costing them victory. Leslie and Bethenny blamed each other for this, with Leslie saying it was Bethenny's responsibility to order the furniture, and Bethenny accusing Leslie of taking too long to come up with a concept on the first day, causing the entire project to be rushed.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Leslie, Dawn, Bethenny
*'''Eliminated:''' Dawn, for maintaining a terrible attitude, making too many excuses, refusing to paint the room, waking up late, and being in the Conference Room four times in succession.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "You don't seem to be functioning as a member of the team, you are just not effective. So Dawn, I'll say goodbye."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Dawn, I'm sorry that you must leave the team Matchstick. But after four losses, it is clear that you are not making significant contributions to the group, and really don't fit the ideal of a real employee of MSLO. We certainly want you to succeed, and we wish you well. Good luck, and have a good trip home."''
*'''Special note:''' 
** Due to Matchstick being three members down and no clear leader emerging in the group, Martha asked for a volunteer to move over from Primarius and lead the team, which Leslie volunteered to do.
** In the Conference Room, Leslie repeatedly claimed that Matchstick would have won if the sofas had arrived on time. Martha pointed out that firstly that argument was irrelevant since Matchstick ''didn't'' win, and secondly that Leslie couldn't make that claim when she hadn't seen Primarius's suite.

===Week 5: Mixed Greens===
*'''Airdate:''' October 19, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' Wishbone
*'''Project:''' Teams had to create a salad dressing and sell it at a [[Stew Leonard's]] supermarket.
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Jennifer
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Ryan
*'''Winning team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for win:''' While Leslie's strategy of dumping multiple bottles in customers' baskets nearly blew up in their face when they were returned to Matchstick, they ultimately managed to sell almost their entire stock and won by just $20. Matchstick sold 453 bottles of $1,580.97 in profit.
**'''Matchstick's reward:''' A trip on a [[Schooner]] around New York City.
*'''Losing team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Despite a higher price, they sold 50 bottles less than Matchstick. Jennifer struggled to control her team, and Jim's conduct and lewd remarks nearly got their display shut down altogether. Primarius only sold 391 bottles of $1,560.09 in profit.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Jennifer, Jim
*'''Eliminated:''' Jennifer, for her weak leadership, and for not taking Jim off the task when he behaved badly. Martha also found it hard to believe that a prosecutor would be scared of someone working for her.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "It's kind of obvious that you can't defend yourself. Jennifer, you're just not working for me."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Jennifer, thank you for being an ''Apprentice'' candidate. I hope you found it an interesting diversion from your regular job. We're sorry that it didn't work out."''
*'''Special notes:''' 
**In the prologue, Martha requested both teams to report back to the Conference Room. Martha asked Primarius who has not yet been a project leader. Martha selects Ryan to lead Matchstick and Jennifer was asked to lead Primarius. As Martha was discouraged that Matchstick had heavily lost four tasks in a row, she decided to reshuffle the teams. Ryan selects Dawna, Amanda, Leslie, David, and Marcela for Matchstick. Jennifer selects Howie, Sarah, Carrie, Bethenny, and Jim for Primarius.
**Officially Amanda, Dawna, and Ryan are transferred to Matchstick. Bethenny and Jim are transferred to Primarius.
**Sarah, Carrie, Howie, and Jennifer are still in their original team Primarius and David, Leslie, and Marcela are still in Matchstick. 
**Matchstick wins for the first time in the series, putting David and Marcela on the winning team for the first (and in David's case, only) time.
**This is the first time a two-person boardroom takes place and it is the first time Martha chooses the final boardroom candidates instead of the project manager.
**After Jennifer left, Charles and Alexis admitted they couldn't even remember what she'd done during any of the prior tasks. Consequently, Martha's letter to Jennifer ended up being by far the shortest one given to a departing candidate this season, and said little beyond wishing her well in the future.
**Wishbone debuted a new television commercial during this episode, featuring Charles and Alexis eating Wishbone salad dressing. In the ad, Alexis jokingly whispers to Charles that they can't let her mother know they're eating Wishbone dressing.

===Week 6: Every Dog Has His Day===
*'''Airdate:''' October 26, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Nestlé Purina PetCare Company|Purina Beneful]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had to create an auction package with various celebrities and then raise the most money during the auction.
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Jim
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Marcela
*'''Winning team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for win:''' Their celebrity experiences sold for generally very high prices. Primarius's revenue was $44,100.
**'''Primarius's reward:''' No reward, as this was a charity event.
*'''Losing team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Despite the exceptionally high final bid for their Fran Drescher experience (which nearly won them the task single-handedly), their other items sold for much lower average prices than those of Primarius. Matchstick's revenue was $40,350. 
**'''Martha's thoughts:''' When asked who should be eliminated, half of them called out Marcela for being a weak PM and not making a single contribution to the negotiations, while the other half called out David for not only not contributing to the negotiations, but being young &amp; inexperienced. Martha had enough evidence to claim David &amp; Marcela as the weakest players on the team, and requested both to be sent back to the Conference Room.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Marcela, David
*'''Eliminated:''' David, for not contributing a lot on the task and for being too young and inexperienced. Martha could have eliminated Marcela for not only being a weak PM, but not actually taking the negotiations correctly. But in the end, David was sent home for being ineffective in the negotiations with Merv Griffin and for playing safe on all the tasks he performed, including a weak self-defense on why he's well-suited to be in the process than Marcela.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "Right now, I think you need a little more experience. You're not ready for an executive position. Good-bye."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear David, thank you for your effort and your good-natured smile. I'm afraid that for this position, you really need some more business experience. If and when you are ready to talk internet to my internet department, we'd love to accommodate you. I admire your entrepreneurial spirit, and I know you will be successful."''
*'''Special notes:'''
**Matchstick's celebrities included [[Chad Pennington]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Bruce Vilanch]], [[Jordan Allard]], and [[Merv Griffin]]. 
**Primarius' celebrities included [[Paul Sorvino|Paul]] &amp; [[Amanda Sorvino]], [[Susan Lucci]], [[John Lithgow]] &amp; [[Joanna Gleason]], and [[Todd Oldham]].
**Martha once again chooses the boardroom candidates.
**This was Bethenny and Jim's first win. All other candidates who were still in the game had at least one win.
**The charity auction was first used on the sixth episode of ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' season 1.
**In her closing letter to David, Martha asked him to keep in touch with her. While she did not consider him executive material, she said that she was impressed by the ideas he had for her website, and indicated that she might be able to give him a different role at her company in the future.

===Week 7: Swimming Against the Tide===
*'''Airdate:''' November 2, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Tide (brand)|Tide]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had to create a live/performing billboard showcasing the new Tide to Go pen.
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Sarah
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Dawna
*'''Winning team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for win:''' Guest judge Peter Arnell really loved Matchstick's concept of creating a boxing-themed character for the live billboard, feeling that the character was well-developed enough that Tide could have immediately employed it in their actual campaign.
**'''Matchstick's reward:''' Breakfast at [[Martha Stewart]]'s home in Bedford with Peter Arnell.
*'''Losing team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Sarah did not pay attention to the task briefing and instead treated their event primarily as a promotional give-away, not giving any real thought to the live billboard performance until about an hour beforehand. As a result, the event consisted of nothing more than the team repeatedly chanting "It's time for Tide to Go!" on their mobile stage with a bunch of street performers performing wholly unrelated acts. Peter called this the "most pathetic" display he had ever seen, noting that it was the kind of presentation that could instantly destroy the reputation of a company, and whoever commissioned it.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Initially, all of Primarius were recalled to the Conference Room because of the massive failure of the task. However, Martha asked Sarah who she would send back to the apartment, and she selected Jim, who it was generally agreed had been the most effective member of the team.
*'''Eliminated:'''
** Sarah, for her lousy leadership ability, inability to control her team, especially considering that she was an event planner by profession, and for repeatedly ignoring the suggestions of her teammates despite not having any strong ideas herself.
** Carrie, for being Sarah's second-in-command, for also failing to come up with a strategy despite her creative background, and for having gone under the radar since winning as project manager on the second task. While Martha held Sarah to be primarily accountable for the loss, she decided to also eliminate Carrie as punishment for the disastrous failure of the task.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "Sarah, Carrie... neither one of you fit in."
**'''Martha's letter (to Sarah):''' ''"Dear Sarah, I think if you work on your leadership skills, you can have a very successful career. You're young, appealing, attractive, and smart. I look forward to hearing about your next steps in the world of business."''
**'''Martha's letter (to Carrie):''' ''"Dear Carrie, it was a difficult decision to choose you over your team-mates. But I think you and Sarah both failed your team in leadership and especially ideas. I wish you well, and hope you focus on a career which uses your other considerable talents."''
*'''Special notes:'''
**Martha eliminates two people for the first time in the history of the show.
** This is the third occurrence of more than one person being fired or sent home on the Apprentice series. The first was Maria and Wes in the second season of [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|Donald Trump's ''Apprentice'']]. The second had ironically occurred the previous week when Josh, Jennifer M., James and Mark were all fired for mass incompetence in the worst managed task in the history of Trump's show. A few weeks later, once again on Trump's ''Apprentice'', Trump fired Brian and Marshawn, and then a few weeks after that, Trump fired Felisha and Alla. 
**Martha thought that Primarius had the worst failure of this task of this history of this show. The previews for the episode had featured Ryan (of Matchstick) in spandex as superhero "Tide-to-Go Joe", mock-punching Marcela (dressed up as a ketchup stain), thus leading many viewers to assume that Matchstick failed miserably. As it turned out, Peter Arnell loved Matchstick's presentation.
**Dawna is the first person to be project manager twice, as well as the first to win twice.
**Tide debuted a new television commercial during the episode, featuring a [[drill sergeant]] brandishing the Tide-to-Go pen and offering a contest for free tickets to ''The Apprentice: Martha Stewart'' live finale.
**Howie actually had the idea to do a boxing-related campaign as well, but Sarah ignored his suggestion, despite not having any other ideas at all by that point. Sarah and Carrie agreed to gang up on Howie in the Conference Room, but this tactic backfired when Charles reminded them that they had repeatedly shrugged off the ideas that he and Bethenny presented.
**According to Martha, the whole team except Jim did a lousy job on this task. She did give a little credit to Bethenny and Howie, for at least trying to come up with ideas despite being blocked at every turn by Sarah, but warned them that she expected them both to step up and make a strong effort in the next task.

===Week 8: Don't Touch That Dial===
*'''Airdate:''' November 9, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[QVC]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had to sell items on QVC. Matchstick sold a Self-Retracting Hose and Primarius sold the Bonnaire cordless self inflater. 
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Bethenny
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Ryan
*'''Winning team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for win:''' While they sold fewer units, they got a higher price and a total profit of over $14,000.
**'''Matchstick's reward:''' A helicopter ride to [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] and a tour of one of Martha Stewart's homes with [[Kevin Sharkey]].
*'''Losing team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Although they sold more units than Matchstick, they struggled on their sales pitch on QVC. Jim had a good sales pitch, but kept talking over Dawna and didn't look at the camera. Much of this was blamed on Howie, who did a last minute swap with Jim in the directors' role, leaving both the men completely unprepared for their new positions. They ended up with total sales of $11,000.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Bethenny, Jim, Howie
**'''Martha's thoughts:''' Martha questioned Bethenny's leadership quality in that she was unable to control her team. Bethenny sensed weakness that she recognized her liability. Martha was also concerned about Howie's contributions in this task and felt that he did not push his full passion throughout the entire process.
*'''Eliminated:''' Howie, for not putting enough effort into his original co-hosting role with Dawna, which led to his last-minute swap with Jim and ultimately caused the task to fail.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "Howie, I just don't get what you would do in our kind of company."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Howie, I know you are successful, and I think that if you do put the effort into your own, home-started business with your wife, it will burgeon and grow. You are proud of your customer base; continue to service it, and you will reap great rewards."''
*'''Special notes:'''
**Due to having the best performance record, Dawna is transferred back to Primarius because Matchstick has 5 players and Primarius has 3 players. Martha decided that the remaining players on Primarius needed help from a strong candidate due to the magnitude of the previous task's failure.
**There was tension between Dawna and her new teammates throughout the task, after an incident early on she openly accused them of spending too much time goofing around and suggested that was why the team kept losing. Despite the other Primarius members in turn accusing her of being stiff and humorless, Dawna ultimately felt vindicated by the result, as Howie's failure to make a serious effort on the first day ended up derailing the task.
**After letting Dawna go, Bethenny said that she had made a mistake and felt that she should have brought Dawna back instead of Jim, but Martha told her it was irrelevant, as she wouldn't even have considered sending Dawna home had she been brought back, and also didn't have any major reason to eliminate Jim since he had at least made an effort on the task.
**The QVC task was first seen in ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' season 2 episode 5.
**Ads for this episode zeroed in on Jim, calling him "the male Omarosa", a reference to controversial ''Apprentice'' personality [[Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth]].

===Week 9: The Coffee Achievers===
*'''Airdate:''' November 16, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Tassimo]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had to sell the Tassimo Coffee Maker.
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Jim
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Marcela
*'''Winning team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for win:''' Despite a slow start, their sales eventually picked up after a strong push by the promotional company that Dawna hired. The three remaining team members also proved very effective at selling the coffee makers. Primarius sold 36 coffee units for a total revenue of $6,621.
**'''Primarius' reward:''' A plane ride to [[Bar Harbor, Maine]] and a tour of one of Martha Stewart's homes with her daughter Alexis.
*'''Losing team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Matchtstick showed subpar energy during sales. Marcela overrode Ryan's original plan of a celebrity endorsement from [[Vincent Pastore]] in favor of hiring a pastry chef to cook free pastries to go with the sample drinks. All this resulted in was a heavy footflow of people looking for snacks, and less sales. To make things worse, the coffee makers were priced far too high at $299. As a result, they only sold 9 coffee units for $1,891, losing by $4,730.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Marcela, Amanda, Ryan
**'''Martha's thoughts:''' In the Conference Room, Martha, Charles, and Alexis criticized Matchstick for lacking the "fire in the belly" with no chemistry and less teamwork in this task. Amanda effectively sealed her fate early in the conference room when she admitted that she "didn't support" Marcela during the task. She later claimed that what she really meant was that she disagreed with the decisions that Marcela was making, but Martha accused Amanda of backtracking and told her that it was too late to take back her comments, right before sending her home.
*'''Eliminated:''' Amanda, for being disloyal and unhelpful to Marcela, and failing to convince Martha that she was in the competition for the right reasons. Marcela was criticized for (again) being a mediocre PM, little respect to her team (especially when coming up with concepts of the promotional sales) and having no ability to control her team, but Amanda was sent home for not showing Martha that she's a team player.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "Team-work is one of the most important things, and for that reason, Amanda, I have to say good-bye."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Amanda, you have certain talents that can be used in many ways. I do think you should focus on those things that interest you. Gardening, marketing, etcetera. I hope you have as much passion for your garden as you expressed. I know it will bring you and your family much joy."''
*'''Special notes:'''
**Jim encouraged Marcela, who had said if she lost as PM twice she would be ready to go home, to fight against Ryan and Amanda because he claimed he was previously in the scapegoat position (although he himself had put Dawn in a scapegoat position in episode 2). In the following episode Jim said that he had been hoping to keep in Marcela at the expense of Ryan, who he viewed as (along with Dawna) his strongest competition, though was happy for Amanda to have gone home.
**This was the first reward for Bethenny and Jim. Their sole previous task win, the charity auction, had no reward, as Martha felt giving to charity was reward enough.
**Vincent Pastore, who was mentioned but not seen on this episode due to Marcela vetoing Ryan's plan for him to appear, would later be a contestant on ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 7)|The Celebrity Apprentice]]'', as well as having a cameo in ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 8)|The Celebrity Apprentice 2]]''.

===Week 10: A Ridiculous Display===
*'''Airdate:''' November 30, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Buick]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had set up a show room for the new [[Buick Lucerne]].
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Dawna
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Leslie
*'''Winning team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for win:''' Their show room was very elegant and professional looking by using an artwork gallery, and having the car as the central piece of the display. As a result, the Buick executives decided to adopt it for show rooms nationwide.
**'''Primarius' reward:''' A dinner at the [[Four Seasons Hotel]] with Charles Koppelman, chairman of MSO, and Susan Lyne, president and chief executive officer.
*'''Losing team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Martha and the executives liked Ryan's concept of the car being invited to dinner (showing it was more than just a vehicle, and part of the family), but thought that the execution was awful. The table in the showroom looked more like a bed, and Leslie's editing of the advert Ryan made caused the message to be lost.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Leslie, Ryan, and Marcela
*'''Eliminated:''' Leslie, for her terrible record as PM of 0-2, her lack of creativity, and her bad execution of Ryan's concept.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "Thank you, Leslie, but we just don't need you."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Leslie, you almost made it to the last task. However, your skills would be put to better use in a marketing or consulting company, not MSLO. Focus on what you do best, and I have no doubt that you will continue to be successful."''
*'''Special notes:'''
**With this Primarius victory, Dawna now has three wins as project manager, but more noteworthy is her spotless record. She only has been on a losing team twice, and neither time had she been brought back to the boardroom by the project manager.
**While Leslie and Marcela initially seemed to agree to gang up on Ryan in the conference room, when Martha actually asked Leslie who should be sent home she replied that it should be Marcela. Marcela felt betrayed, as she specifically avoided bringing Leslie back in the previous episode due to their close friendship, which resulted in a major argument between the two.

===Week 11: Final Approach===
*'''Airdate:''' December 7, 2005
*'''Hosting Company:''' [[Song (airline)|Song Airlines]]
*'''Project:''' Teams had create a thirty-second commercial for a $99 Song Airlines flight from New York's [[JFK Airport|JFK]] to Los Angeles' [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]].
*'''Primarius project manager:''' Bethenny
*'''Matchstick project manager:''' Ryan
*'''Winning team:''' Primarius
**'''Reasons for win:''' Their advert on the whole was very well executed, scoring an average of 4.2 from the focus group. As a result, the executives have decided to run Primarius's advert as a "real spot".
**'''Primarius' reward:''' Horseback riding with Martha Stewart at her Bedford home and a game of [[Scrabble]].
*'''Losing team:''' Matchstick
**'''Reasons for loss:''' Their advert was extremely sloppy, and Ryan completely missed their target demographic, having come up with the concept before even speaking to the executives. Their advert had an average rating of just 2.8 from the surveys.
**'''Sent to Conference Room:''' Ryan and Marcela
**'''Eliminated:''' ''Both of them'', for the following reasons:
***Ryan, for drinking during the task and producing an ad that was not only extremely poor in quality, but inappropriate for Song Airlines' target audience.
***Marcela, for her horrible record as project manager of 0-2, being on three wins and eight losses, not contributing any ideas toward the advert, and admitting having effectively given up on the competition before the task even began.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "Neither one of you really fit in." 
**'''Martha's letter (to Ryan):''' ''"Dear Ryan, you have the desire to try new things, and a lot of self-confidence. I think you need more focus, and possibly more education, in business for example. I know you will then be ready for a big challenge."''
**'''Martha's letter (to Marcela):''' ''"Dear Marcela, your passion for food in the Hispanic market in America, and your hard work, are qualities we admire at MSLO. I think you have the makings for a really good food editor, food maker and even television performer."''
*'''Special notes:'''
**This is the second time Martha sent home more than one candidate, six including Trump's multiple-firings throughout the history of ''The Apprentice''. 
**Matchstick is "out of business", as both Marcela and Ryan were the last members of the group. Including Trump's [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 4)|Season 4]], in which Capital Edge went out of business following the eliminations of both Felisha and Alla, there have been two instances where a company has been shut down simply because all of the remaining candidates were eliminated. 
**Martha was puzzled as to why Marcela didn't step up as project manager, given that she had failed twice while Ryan had already proved himself as a project manager with two victories. Marcela responded by saying that she thought she would be fired whether she or Ryan led the task and thus didn't see the point in stepping up to manage the team, and this admission was largely responsible for her being sent home.
**Despite the overwhelmingly negative reaction to Ryan's leadership and the advert that he produced, Charles indicated that he was sorry to see Ryan go, and had seen potential in him earlier in the season.
**Dawna is the ''only'' candidate entering the next task having not been to the final conference room. She leads the series with a corporate record of 9-2, and a PM record of 3-0.
**This episode aired after [[Delta Air Lines]], which owns and operates Song, announced would eradicate the Song brand name in May 2006, and incorporate its aircraft into Delta's main operations.

===Week 12: The Interviews and the Ultimate Task===
*'''Airdate:''' December 14, 2005
*'''Task:''' One-on-one interviews with four important executives from Martha Stewart Living, including some the candidates might recognize from their reward dinners.
*'''Result:''' Dawna got near-unanimous praise from all four interviewers with her excellent business &amp; management competency, the only major criticisms being that they felt she was a little too conservative, and was telling them the answers she felt they wanted to hear. Bethenny also got generally very positive comments, and was praised for her energy, creativity and determination, though was criticized of lacking focus. Jim on the other hand got overwhelmingly negative feedback, for his bizarre and at times inappropriate interview responses, terrible attitude, and indirectly admitting that he saw the process as a game rather than a job interview, with all four interviewers agreeing that they would not employ him in any role.
*'''Eliminated:''' Jim, for being a loose cannon, treating the entire process as a game, and at the recommendation of the four executives.
**'''Dismissal comment:''' "The game is over, Jim. You are out of here."
**'''Martha's letter:''' ''"Dear Jim, I know you surprised yourself in this competition. I am proud that you went from a badly-losing team to one of the final three. You certainly surprised many people, finally allowing your creativity to shine, and your lack of focus to diminish. You succeeded where many thought you might fail. My best wishes to your patient family; they will be happy to have you home. I hope to see and hear from you in the future."''
**'''Final Two:''' Dawna and Bethenny
**For the final task, Bethenny and Dawna had to select three of the 14 eliminated candidates since the stakes of the final task is abnormally high
*'''Final Project for Bethenny:''' Hold a Circus event for the Apple &amp; Eve Circus in association with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America
**'''Bethenny's Recruits:''' Ryan, Jim, and Carrie
*'''Final Project for Dawna:''' Liz Claiborne Fashion Show and Charity Event for Safe Horizon (an organization combating domestic violence)
**'''Dawna's Recruits:''' Amanda, Howie, and Sarah
*'''Special notes:'''
**There are no more teams or project managers&amp;mdash;''all candidates'' are now on their own.
**The one-on-one interviews with the executives has always been an ''Apprentice'' Tradition. 
**This competition required an interview week because the remaining candidates went from five to three at the end of week 11, unlike Trump's [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 4)|season 4]], which did not require an interview week because the remaining candidates went from four candidates to two at the end of week 11. 
**Martha agreed that the decision to eliminate Jim was so obvious that they didn't even ask him (nor Bethenny or Dawna) to justify staying in the show, and immediately sent him home upon calling the final three into the conference room. 
**After being announced as the final two, Bethenny and Dawna congratulated each other upon returning to the loft, and celebrated their coronation as finalists with champagne.
**Both finalists also browsed a photo album containing pictures of the fourteen eliminated candidates.
**Jim, although happy to work with Bethenny, was perplexed as to why she chose Carrie, with whom she argued in episode 7, and Ryan, with whom she never worked. Jim said that Bethenny had no friends and that's why she chose a rather odd group of people.
**In pure ''Apprentice'' tradition, the first part of the final task ended with the final two facing conflicts that could lead to failure. In this case, Dawna thinks Howie could cost her the job, and Bethenny with numerous workers who have no tasks.

===Week 13: Decision Time===
*'''Airdate:''' December 21, 2005
*'''Setting:''' The studio in which Martha's daytime show, ''Martha'' takes place, live in ''The Apprentice'' tradition.
*'''Pre-Recorded Material:''' Conclusion of the final tasks
**Bethenny's circus event was fun and successful, but Bethenny was a bit cold towards her teammates. 
***Bethenny's coldness was especially evident at the end of the task, when she left her teammates without saying much in the way of praise, in stark contrast to Dawna's emotional farewell to her team.
***Martha was also concerned that Bethenny disregarded her subordinates and had a few rough edges, which jeopardized Bethenny's job application nearing the end of the finale.
**Dawna's Liz Claiborne fashion show event went smoothly as well
***The company's main concern was that the event brochures were rushed, after the Liz Claiborne executives made last-minute changes of the clothing-line and the show atmosphere; but ultimately none of Dawna's weaknesses affected her job application.
*'''Runner-up:''' Bethenny for showing disrespect to her subordinates, being a show-off, and having excessive need to make physical impressions.
*'''Hired:''' Dawna, for not only her outstanding PM record of 3-0 &amp; track record of 9-2, but mainly her exemplary business experience and her competency in management. (Martha to Dawna: "I would like to offer you the job of being my apprentice.")
**'''Dawna's Job:''' Development Director for MSLO's ''Body + Soul'' magazine, based in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] suburb of [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].
*'''Special notes:'''
**The Live Finale was only one hour long (as opposed to two for Donald Trump's ''Apprentice'').
**At the end of the show, [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] was passed around to the candidates in celebration of Dawna's coronation. However, Martha refused to offer any [[alcoholic beverage]] to Dawna herself, since she wanted Dawna to celebrate her coronation driving away in a new [[Buick Lucerne]].
**As the series began, a possible [[conflict of interest]] arose, as Frankel used to be friends with Jennifer Koppelman-Hutt.&lt;ref name=Jenniferhutt&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Hutt website|url=http://jenniferhutt.com/|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutt is the daughter of [[Charles Koppelman]], and is also [[Alexis Stewart]]'s partner and co-host on a radio program broadcast through the [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] network.  Koppelman and Alexis Stewart served as Martha's "eyes and ears," observing the performance of candidates during various tasks in the competition.

{{Donald Trump series}}{{short description|Donald Trump's association with golf}}
[[Donald Trump]] is closely associated with the sport of [[golf]].&lt;ref name="stanley20161123" /&gt; As a real estate developer,&lt;ref name="GolfDigest" /&gt; Trump began acquiring and constructing [[golf courses]] in 1999. By the time of his [[2016 United States presidential election|election]] as United States President in 2016, he owned 17 golf courses worldwide through his [[holding company]], [[the Trump Organization]].&lt;ref name="stanley20161123" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GolfDigest" /&gt; Courses owned by Trump have been selected to host various [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|PGA]] and [[LPGA]] events, including the upcoming 2022 [[PGA Championship]].&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;

Following his election, Trump broke precedent with recent presidents and chose not to [[Divestment|divest]] from his business holdings, including his golf courses. Although not illegal, this led to criticism from ethics lawyers and journalists for potential [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. At least three lawsuits ([[D.C. and Maryland v. Trump]], [[Blumenthal v. Trump]] and [[CREW v. Trump]]) have been filed claiming that foreign payments at Trump golf courses and hotels violate the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause|Emoluments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. 

==Background==
Trump, according to [[Jack Nicklaus]], "loves the game of golf more than he loves money". According to ''[[Golf Digest]]'', his [[handicap (golf)|handicap]] is as low as 2.8.&lt;ref name="stanley20161123"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_au/article/triple-bogey-diplomacy-how-australia-and-new-zealand-might-use-golf-in-the-age-of-trump|title=Triple Bogey Diplomancy: How Australia and New Zealand Might Use Golf in the Age of Trump|last=Stanley|first=Ben|date=November 23, 2016|work=Vice|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124162000/https://sports.vice.com/en_au/article/triple-bogey-diplomacy-how-australia-and-new-zealand-might-use-golf-in-the-age-of-trump|archive-date=November 24, 2016|url-status=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump began playing golf during his college years at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=GolfDigest/&gt; In the introduction to his 2005 book ''The Best Golf Advice I Ever Received'', Trump wrote, "for me and millions of people—men, women, young and old around the world—golf is more than a game. It is a passion."&lt;ref name=Trump2005/&gt;

In 1999, Trump opened his first golf course: the [[Trump International Golf Club (West Palm Beach)|Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach]] in Florida. Land for the US$45&amp;nbsp;million course was acquired through a lawsuit against [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], after Trump's purchase of the [[Mar-a-Lago]] resort.&lt;ref name=Golf2007/&gt; By 2007, Trump owned 4 courses around the US.&lt;ref name=Golf2007/&gt; Following the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], Trump began purchasing existing golf courses and re-designing them.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;

Golf courses owned by Trump hosted the [[LPGA]] Tour finale from 2001 to 2008, as well as the 2009 [[U.S. Junior Amateur Golf Championship|US Junior Amateur]] and [[United States Girls' Junior Golf Championship|US Junior Girls Championships]].&lt;ref name=Golf/&gt;In 2014, the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America]] announced a multi-year partnership with [[the Trump Organization]]. The PGA of America selected Trump golf courses to host the 2017 [[Senior PGA Championship]] and the 2022 [[PGA Championship]].&lt;ref name=PGA/&gt;

[[File:The Donald &amp; Mark Wahlberg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Donald Trump and [[Mark Wahlberg]] in 2006]]

In June 2015, Trump announced his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|candidacy]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] with a controversial speech which led to companies such as [[Macy's]] and [[NBC]] cutting ties with the businessman.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; While speaking on [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], Trump claimed that Mexico is "sending people that have lots of problems... they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," drawing criticism from immigration and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] [[advocacy groups]].&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; The LPGA, PGA of America, [[PGA Tour]], and [[United States Golf Association]] issued a joint statement, saying that while the organizations "do not usually comment on presidential politics, Mr. Trump's comments are inconsistent with our strong commitment to an inclusive and welcoming environment in the game of golf."&lt;ref name=GolfDigest2015/&gt; The PGA of America also decided to relocate the 2015 [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]—an exhibition match which had been scheduled to take place at [[Trump National Golf Club (Los Angeles)|Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Other upcoming events at Trump courses were not affected.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; In 2018, [[PGA Tour Latinoamérica]] held its [[2018 PGA Tour Latinoamérica|Shell Tour Championship]] at [[Trump National Doral Miami]]'s Golden Palm course after plans were announced to demolish the Melreese Country Club in Miami, which had held the event, for a football stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=David |last=Wilson |title= PGA Tour Latinoamérica is bringing its championship to Trump's Doral course.

Trump previously licensed his name to the Trump International Golf Club in [[Puerto Rico]], which served as host of the PGA Tour's [[Puerto Rico Open]]. The course filed for bankruptcy protection in 2015. According to [[The Trump Organization|Trump Organization]] executive vice president [[Eric Trump]], the organization "merely licensed our name for a fee and [had] nothing to do with the ownership, development or entity."&lt;ref name=CNBC/&gt;

==Coats of arms==
Trump has used a number of logos in the style of coats of arms for his businesses.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Joseph E. Davies.svg|thumb|upright|right|The coat of arms granted to Davies in 1939 bears the [[motto]] "''Integritas''".]]
[[Joseph E. Davies]], third husband of [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]] and a former US ambassador of Welsh origins, was granted a coat of arms by [[King of Arms#Kings of Arms for England, Wales and Northern Ireland|British heraldic authorities]] in 1939. After Trump purchased [[Mar-a-Lago]], the Florida estate built by Merriweather Post, in 1985, the [[The Trump Organization|Trump Organization]] started using Davies's coat of arms at [[Trump National Golf Club (disambiguation)|Trump golf courses]] and estates across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hakim|first1=Danny|title=The Coat of Arms Said 'Integrity'.

In 2008, Trump attempted to establish the American logo at his new [[Trump International Golf Links, Scotland|Trump International Golf Links]] in [[Balmedie]], [[Scotland]], but was warned by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], the highest authority for [[Scottish heraldry]], that an act of the [[Scottish Parliament]] from 1672 disallows people using unregistered arms. In January 2012, shortly after the inauguration of the golf course, Trump unveiled the new coat of arms&lt;ref name="deadline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guest|title=Donald Trump awarded Scottish coat of arms after four-year battle|url=http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2012/01/17/donald-trump-at-last-awarded-the-scottish-coat-of-arms/|accessdate=February 14, 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had been granted to "The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd" by the Lord Lyon in 2011:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Court of the Lord Lyon|first1=[https://twitter.com/LyonCourt @LyonCourt]|url=https://twitter.com/LyonCourt/status/798120353948049408|website=Twitter|access-date=February 14, 2018|date=November 14, 2016|title=Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd was granted arms in 2011, replacing an assumed design they had previously used.}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency==
Following his election in 2016, Trump announced that he would not [[Divestment|divest]] his business holdings, as other recent presidents had. Instead, Trump kept his ownership stake in [[the Trump Organization]] and appointed his sons [[Donald Trump Jr.]] and [[Eric Trump]] to manage the business.&lt;ref name=USAToday2017/&gt; In an unusual rebuke from the [[United States Office of Government Ethics|Office of Government Ethics]], director [[Walter Shaub]] called Trump's actions "wholly inadequate" and "meaningless from a [[conflict of interest]] perspective."&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Trump explained: "As far as the, you know, potential conflict of interests, though, I mean I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest."&lt;ref name=NYTimes2016/&gt;

Just days after his [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]], [[CREW v. Trump|a lawsuit]] was filed in federal court seeking to block the president from receiving payments from foreign government entities at his businesses. The lawsuit alleged that these payments constitute a violation of the [[Title of Nobility Clause|Foreign Emoluments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes2017/&gt; In February 2017, the president invited [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Shinzō Abe]] to play at the [[Trump International Golf Club (West Palm Beach)|Trump International Golf Club]] in Florida and stay at Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] resort. Legal and ethical concerns were raised by organizations such as the [[Sunlight Foundation]] over foreign payments the president may receive from the visit. Trump has vowed to donate any such payments to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], although the specifics of this arrangement remain unclear.&lt;ref name=NBCNews/&gt; In June 2017, the [[Attorney General of Maryland|attorney generals of Maryland]] and [[Attorney General for the District of Columbia|the District of Columbia]] filed [[D.C. and Maryland v. Trump|a separate lawsuit]], claiming the president was "flagrantly violating" the Emoluments Clause.&lt;ref name=WaPo6_2017/&gt;

A 2016 investigation by ''[[USA Today]]'' found that [[lobbyist]]s and [[Senior management|corporate executives]] had been purchasing memberships at Trump golf courses to gain favor or contact with the president. Membership fees at Trump courses can exceed US$100,000, leading to ethical concerns over a sitting president accepting money from people lobbying the government.&lt;ref name=USAToday7_2017/&gt;

While campaigning to be president, Trump declared in August 2016: "I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to play golf".&lt;ref name=TrumpContradictTrump&gt;{{cite web |last1=Superville |first1=Darlene |title=He said-he said: 10 times that Trump has contradicted Trump |url=https://www.apnews.com/495269c1760c4268b6fa3162dffd1eb3 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=June 22, 2019 |date=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming president, the amount of time he spent golfing generated controversy. Despite frequently criticizing his predecessor [[Barack Obama]] as having played golf too much as president, Trump golfed 11 times during his first eight weeks in office, when Obama did not golf at all in his first eight weeks, although Golf Digest concluded that Obama played 306 rounds of golf over his two terms, which the magazine describes as "...a fairly remarkable amount of golf while in office.".&lt;ref name=GolfDigest2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=GolfDigestJan2017/&gt; 

According to [[CNN]], Trump visited Trump-owned golf courses 92 times between becoming president in January 2017 and January 3, 2018, although the White House does not disclose when the president actually plays golf during a visit to a golf course.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; And the White House has on some occasions denied that Trump played golf during his visits even after photos published on social media showed him playing golf.&lt;ref name="TrumpContradictTrump" /&gt; In November 2018, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' found that the average number of days between golf rounds was around 5 days for Trump, and around 12–13 days for Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bump |first1=Philip |title=Trump played so little golf last month that he tied Obama |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/23/trump-played-so-little-golf-last-month-that-he-tied-obama |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=June 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Journalists and ethics experts have alleged that these frequent visits are a means of boosting publicity at the courses to sell more memberships.&lt;ref name="MiamiHerald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] defended the president's golfing, saying that his time on the course was spent "developing deeper and better relationships with members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] in which those relationships have helped push forward the president's agenda." But CNN reported in January 2018 that Trump was known to have played golf with members of Congress only seven times at a Trump-owned golf course.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

Vice president [[Mike Pence]] stayed at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland in 2019 while meeting with Irish officials in [[Dublin]]. Pence was originally going to end his trip in [[Doonbeg]], where he has familial ties, but Trump suggested that he stay at the Trump property instead, which required daily flights of a more than one hour each way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-made-suggestion-pence-stay-president-s-irish-golf-club-n1049026|title=Trump made 'suggestion' Pence stay at president's Irish golf club, VP's chief of staff says|last=Smith|first=Allan|date=September 3, 2019|publisher=NBC News|access-date=September 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Donald Trump series}}
The net worth of [[Donald Trump]], the 45th [[president of the United States]], is not publicly known. Various news organizations have attempted to estimate Trump's wealth, including ''[[Forbes]]'', which put it at about US $2.1 billion {{as of|2020|4|7|lc=y|df=}}.&lt;ref name="forbes-2019-billionaires2"&gt;{{cite magazine|year=2019|title=The World's Billionaires – No. 715 Donald Trump|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/donald-trump/?list=billionaires|magazine=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=April 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gifts, loans, and other wealth from his father==
According to an investigation by the ''New York Times'', Donald Trump received at least $413&amp;nbsp;million (2018 prices) from his father's business empire.&lt;ref name = "takeaways"/&gt; The ''New York Times'' drew upon more than 100,000 pages of tax returns and financial records from [[Fred Trump]]'s businesses and interviews with former advisers and employees, finding 295 distinct streams of revenue that Fred Trump created over five decades in order to channel his wealth to his son.&lt;ref name="takeaways"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tax_Schemes"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html| title= Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father|last1=Barstow|first1=David|date=October 2, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 2, 2018| last2=Craig|first2=Susanne|last3=Buettner|first3=Russ|author1link=David Barstow| author2link=Susanne Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trust funds===
Trump is the beneficiary of several trust funds set up by his father and paternal grandmother beginning in 1949 when he was three years old.&lt;ref name="Kessler160303"&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Kessler |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |title=Trump's false claim he built his empire with a 'small loan' from his father |date=March 3, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/03/trumps-false-claim-he-built-his-empire-with-a-small-loan-from-his-father}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New York Times, he "was a millionaire by age 28",&lt;ref name="takeaways"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-wealth-fred-trump.html |title=11 Takeaways From The Times's Investigation Into Trump's Wealth|last1=Barstow|first1=David|date=October 2, 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 3, 2018|last2=Craig|first2=Susanne|last3=Buettner|first3=Russ|author1link=David Barstow|author2link=Susanne Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tax_Schemes" /&gt; In 1976, Fred set up trust funds of $1&amp;nbsp;million (${{Inflation|US|1|1976|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) for each of his five children and three grandchildren. Donald Trump received  $90,000 in 1980 and $214,605 in 1981 through the fund.&lt;ref name="Kessler160303" /&gt;

===Alleged tax-fraud schemes===
Donald Trump was also involved in a number of purportedly fraudulent tax schemes. When Fred Trump sold shares in ''Trump Palace'' condos to his son well below their purchase price, masking what could be considered a hidden donation, and benefiting from a tax write-off.&lt;ref name="Tax_Schemes" /&gt; A lawyer for Trump denied the allegations, calling them "100 percent false, and highly defamatory". A spokesman for the New York State tax department said the agency was "vigorously pursuing all appropriate areas of investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/03/new-york-trump-tax-fraud/1512265002/|title=New York could levy hefty penalties if Trump tax fraud is proven|last=Campbell|first=Jon|date=October 3, 2018|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=October 5, 2018| last2=Spector| first2=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City officials also indicated they are examining the matter of Trump's alleged fraudulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/politics/donald-trump-fred-trump-tax-schemes.html|title=New York Regulators Examine the Trump Family's Tax Schemes|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inheritance===
In 1993, when Trump took two loans totaling $30&amp;nbsp;million from his siblings, their anticipated shares of Fred's estate amounted to $3.5&amp;nbsp;million each.&lt;ref name="OBrien2005Oct"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/business/yourmoney/whats-he-really-worth.html |title=What's He Really Worth? |first=Timothy L. |last=O'Brien |authorlink=Timothy L.

Trump was listed on the initial ''Forbes List'' of wealthy individuals in 1982 as having a share of his family's estimated $200&amp;nbsp;million net worth.&lt;ref name="OBrien2005Oct" /&gt; Former ''Forbes'' reporter Jonathan Greenberg said in 2018 that during the 1980s Trump had deceived him about his actual net worth and his share of the family assets in order to appear on the list. According to Greenberg, 

"it took decades to unwind the elaborate farce Trump had enacted to project an image as one of the richest people in America. Nearly every assertion supporting that claim was untrue. Trump wasn't just poorer than he said he was. Over time, I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all. In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million—a paltry sum by the standards of his super-monied peers—as a spate of government reports and books showed only much later."&lt;ref name="WP-20180420"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-lied-to-me-about-his-wealth-to-get-onto-the-forbes-400-here-are-the-tapes/2018/04/20/ac762b08-4287-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html|title=Trump lied to me about his wealth to get onto the Forbes 400.

After several years on the ''Forbes List'', Trump's financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from 1990 to 1995, and reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993;&lt;ref name="OBrien2005Oct" /&gt; in 2005, ''The New York Times'' referred to Trump's "verbal billions" in a skeptical article about Trump's self-reported wealth.&lt;ref name="OBrien2005Oct" /&gt; At the time, three individuals with direct knowledge of Trump's finances told reporter [[Timothy L.

According to a 2019 study in the journal [[Political Behavior (journal)|''Political Behavior'']], many voters were convinced that Trump is a keen business man and the right choice for the presidency by being told that he [[Inheritance|inherited]] money from his father but then grew a major empire and increased his net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=Jared|last2=Karol|first2=David|last3=Mason|first3=Lilliana|date=January 9, 2019|title="An Inherited Money Dude from Queens County": How Unseen Candidate Characteristics Affect Voter Perceptions|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1007/s11109-019-09527-y|issn=1573-6687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
{{main|Donald J. Trump Foundation}}

Trump formed his own charitable foundation in 1988. In the first decade of the 2000s, he gave away $2.8 million through the foundation (though he had pledged three times that amount). He stopped personally contributing to the foundation in 2008, though he accepted donations from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html|title=Trump promised millions to charity.

It was facing a civil lawsuit by the New York attorney general that alleged "persistently illegal conduct" including self-dealing and funneling campaign contributions. Furthermore, it had never been properly certified in New York and did not submit to the annual audit that would have been required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Trump Foundation lacks the certification required for charities that solicit money|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|date=29 September 2016|work=Washington Post|access-date=13 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dermophis donaldtrumpi''''' is a proposed [[species]] of [[caecilian]] {{endash}} a nearly-blind, serpentine [[amphibian]] {{endash}} to be named after [[Donald Trump]]. It was originally discovered in [[Panama]] and is yet to be confirmed as a new species; as of {{Currentmonth}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the [[binomial name]] has not been formally published. It was given its name after the [[Rainforest Trust]] held an auction for the naming rights. The company [[EnviroBuild]] won the auction and named the species in protest against [[Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration|Trump's environmental policies]] and views.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=MacGuill |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dermophis-donaldtrumpi-amphibian-trump/ |date=December 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |title=Was a Newly-Discovered Species of Amphibian Given the Name 'Dermophis Donaldtrumpi'?|website=[[Snopes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Dermophis donaldtrumpi'' is about {{convert|10|cm|in|0}} long, shiny, slippery, and slimy, with the appearance of a large [[worm]]. It is a [[burrowing]] species, living almost entirely [[Subterranea (geography)|underground]].{{r|sfgate}}{{r|guardian}}&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt; It is nearly blind, with its eyes only able to detect light and dark, so it uses a pair of [[tentacle]]s near its mouth in order to find prey; it also has an extra layer of skin which its young can eat after peeling it off.{{r|sfgate}}

According to the [[Rainforest Trust]], amphibians such as ''D. donaldtrumpi'' are vulnerable to extinction due to being exceptionally sensitive to the results of [[global warming]].{{r|guardian}}

==Naming==
In December 2018, the [[Rainforest Trust]] completed an auction of naming rights for twelve newly discovered species of South American plants and animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/science/species-naming-auction-rainforest-trust.html|title=Want to Name a New Frog? A Whiskered Mouse? An Orchid? Be the Highest Bidder|first=Julia|last=Jacobs|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=December 22, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the money going towards the conservation of the species' habitats.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The sustainable building materials company EnviroBuild paid $25,000 for the right to name the new amphibian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rainforesttrust.org/species-legacy-auction-is-a-resounding-win-for-wildlife-conservation/|title=Species Legacy Auction is a Resounding Win for Wildlife Conservation|last=Antram|first=Alex|date=|work=[[Rainforest Trust]]|access-date=December 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aidan Bell, owner of EnviroBuild, stated that he named the species after Trump to raise awareness of Trump's policies on [[climate change]] and the danger that he sees those policies pose to the survival of many species. Referring to the creature's "rudimentary eyes which can only detect light or dark", Bell said that "Capable of seeing the world only in black and white, Donald Trump has claimed that climate change is a hoax by the Chinese."&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/18/blind-amphibian-named-after-trumps-climate-change-stance|title=Blind creature that buries head in sand named after Donald Trump|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=December 18, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=December 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.envirobuild.com/blogs/articles/donald-trump-amphibian|title=EnviroBuild name an amphibian in honour of Donald Trump's commitment to environmental issues.|last=Bell|first=Aidan|date=December 18, 2018|work=EnviroBuild|access-date=December 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/421934-blind-amphibian-that-buries-head-in-sand-named-after-trump|title=Blind amphibian that buries head in sand named after Trump|last=Daughtery|first=Owen|date=December 18, 2018|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|access-date=December 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' also linked the creature's limited sight as "a feature that inspired it[s] name."&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/blind-amphibian-loves-burrowing-head-13755117|title=Blind amphibian that loves burrowing head in sand is named after DONALD TRUMP|last=Best|first=Shivali|date=December 19, 2018|website=Daily Mirror|access-date=January 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', "The naming choice highlights the president’s dismal approval ratings worldwide and is clearly designed to belittle him."&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news |title=A blind, wormlike amphibian that burrows underground has been named after Donald Trump |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Isaac |last=Stanley-Becker  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/12/19/blind-worm-like-amphibian-that-buries-its-head-underground-has-been-named-after-donald-trump/ |accessdate=December 20, 2018 |date=December 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell also related the caecilian's instincts when nurturing young to what he claims as Trump's [[nepotism]]: "The dermophis genus grows an extra layer of skin which their young use their teeth to peel off and eat, a behaviour known as dermatrophy.{{sic}} As a method of ensuring [his] children survive in life Donald Trump prefers granting them high roles in the [[Oval Office]]."&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; [[Dermatotrophy]], a form of parental care in which the young feed on the skin of its mother, has been scientifically observed in other species of caecilians, such as ''[[Boulengerula taitana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Mark|last2=Nussbaum|first2=Ronald A.|last3=Greven|first3=Hartmut|last4=Jared|first4=Carlos|last5=Antoniazzi|first5=Marta M.|last6=Müller|first6=Hendrik|last7=Kupfer|first7=Alexander|date=April 2006|title=Parental investment by skin feeding in a caecilian amphibian|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=440|issue=7086|pages=926–929|doi=10.1038/nature04403|pmid=16612382|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=2006Natur.440..926K|hdl=2027.42/62957|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62957/1/nature04403.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EnviroBuild further connected the amphibian's nature to [[burrow]] underground with more of the president's policies: “Burrowing its head underground helps Donald Trump when avoiding scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change".&lt;ref name="mirror" /&gt; The company also noted that he had "appointed several energy lobbyists to the [[EPA|Environment Agency]], where their job is to regulate the energy industry.”&lt;ref name="mirror" /&gt;

The process of naming this species has garnered significant controversy among researchers and conservationists; some have pointed out the conservation benefits of the money donated to name the species, while others have criticized the idea of donating to name a new species, as many of the donors had no involvement with the studies undertaken to describe the species. In particular, [[North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]] researcher Christian Kammerer sees the facetious name of the amphibian as "just mean to the creature". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 12, 2019 |url=https://qz.com/1593968/the-pros-and-cons-of-letting-the-public-name-a-new-species/|title=Letting the public name a newly discovered species could go horribly wrong|last=Montanari|first=Shaena|last2=Montanari|first2=Shaena|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2019-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{notelist}}

The '''tax returns of Donald Trump''' have been the subject of controversy for the past several years, particularly over their not having been made public despite his political career.

Before Trump announced his candidacy for president, he repeatedly promised to release his tax returns, making such pledges in 2011, 2014 ("absolutely") and 2015.&lt;ref name="FactPence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harwell"/&gt; During [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]], Trump first said he would release his returns after they were "worked on.”&lt;ref name=fivetimes/&gt; From 2016 to 2019, Trump claimed&lt;!-- Since no evidence has ever been presented that this is true, using "claimed" is justified. --&gt; that, because the returns were being audited, he could not make them public, but would do so in the future. No law actually prevents tax returns from being released due to an audit, as emphasized by the [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|commissioner of internal revenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davison|first1=Laura|last2=Talev|first2=Margaret|title=Trump Falsely Says Law Prevents Him Releasing Tax Returns Under Audit|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-05/trump-refutes-democrats-authority-to-obtain-his-tax-returns|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|access-date=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Orion|last1=Rummler|title=IRS commissioner: No rule against releasing Trump's tax returns while under audit|url=https://www.axios.com/trump-tax-returns-irs-commissioner-audit-20ebb0a7-dc47-4177-bf4c-565aa5cfb734.html|date=10 April 2019|website=[[Axios.com]]|access-date=11 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump later said that voters were not interested in his returns; that "there's nothing to learn from them"; and that his tax rate is "none of your business".&lt;ref name="Harwell"/&gt;

Since Trump's election, he has refused requests to release the returns, making him one of the few presidents in recent times to not reveal their tax returns. Trump was the first major party nominee since 1976 not to make his tax returns public. Several states have proposed bills that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to be listed on the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 ballot]]; such a bill was passed by the [[California Legislature]] and signed by Democratic Governor [[Gavin Newsom]], but was overturned several months later by the [[California Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/07/30/californias-newsom-signs-bill-to-force-trump-tax-returns-1122154|title=California's Newsom signs bill to force Trump tax returns|last=White|first=Jeremy|date=July 30, 2019|work=Politico|access-date=5 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/trump-tax-returns-safe-after-california-court-ruling-on-primary.html|title=California high court tosses law aimed at forcing Trump to release tax returns to get on state primary ballot|date=July 30, 2019|work=CNBC|access-date=20 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] made a formal request to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and later issued a [[subpoena]] to the IRS, for six years of Trump's returns, as part of an effort by the committee to evaluate "the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president."&lt;ref name=WaysMeansSub&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-subpoena.html|title=House Ways and Means Chairman Subpoenas Trump Tax Returns|first=Nicholas|last=Fandos|date=May 10, 2019|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury Secretary [[Steven Mnuchin]] defied the subpoena.&lt;ref name=UPIfinal&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uria|first1=Daniel|title=Mnuchin: Treasury to make 'final decision' on Trump tax returns May 6|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/04/23/Mnuchin-Treasury-to-make-final-decision-on-Trump-tax-returns-May-6/8181556063426/|publisher=[[United Press International]]|access-date=April 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rappeport|first1=Alan|title=Steven Mnuchin Refuses to Release Trump's Tax Returns to Congress|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-mnuchin.html|website=The New York Times|access-date=7 May 2019|date=6 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/democrats-trump-tax-returns.html|title=House Ways and Means Chairman Subpoenas Trump Tax Records|first=Nicholas|last=Fandos|date=May 10, 2019|website=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mnuchin-defies-subpoena-for-president-trumps-tax-returns-11558123367|title=Mnuchin Defies Subpoena for President Trump's Tax Returns|first=Richard|last=Rubin|date=May 17, 2019|newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the Trump administration's refusal to turn over the documents, the Ways and Means Committee filed a suit to enforce the subpoena.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/738030272/house-democrats-sue-for-trumps-tax-returns|title=House Democrats Sue For Trump's Tax Returns|author=Kelsey Snell|date=July 2, 2019|website=NPR|access-date=July 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Quinta Jurecic, [https://www.lawfareblog.com/house-ways-and-means-committee-sues-trump-tax-returns House Ways and Means Committee Sues for Trump Tax Returns], ''Lawfare'' (July 2, 2019).&lt;/ref&gt; That case is pending.&lt;ref name=Thomsen/&gt; A draft IRS legal memo, written in fall 2018 and reported in May 2019, concluded that the IRS must provide the requested tax returns to Congress unless Trump invokes executive privilege, contradicting the administration's justification for defying the earlier subpoena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/confidential-draft-irs-memo-says-tax-returns-must-be-given-to-congress-unless-president-invokes-executive-privilege/2019/05/21/8ed41834-7b1c-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html|title=Confidential draft IRS memo says tax returns must be given to Congress unless president invokes executive privilege|newspaper=Washington Post|date=May 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, the [[House Committee on Oversight and Reform|House Oversight Committee]] issued a subpoena to Trump's accounting firm for tax records and other records, as part of the committee's investigation into (1) whether Trump "may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office"; (2) whether Trump "has undisclosed [[conflicts of interest]] that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions"; (3) whether Trump was complying with the Constitution's [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]] and [[Domestic Emoluments Clause]]; and (4) whether Trump "has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities."&lt;ref name=DCCirDecision/&gt; Trump sued to block the subpoena; the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]], and later the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]], rejected Trump's position and have held that the subpoena must be complied with.&lt;ref name=DCtDDCOversight/&gt;&lt;ref name=FahrentholdDCCir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hemel/&gt;

In late August 2019, the Office of the [[New York County District Attorney]] issued a subpoena to Trump seeking eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns, as part of state prosecutors' investigation into [[Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal|hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential election campaign]].&lt;ref name=TurnOver&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/nyregion/trump-taxes-lawsuit-vance.html|title=Trump Taxes: President Ordered to Turn Over Returns to Manhattan D.A.|last=Rashbaum|first=Weiser|website=The New York Times|date=October 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump sought to quash the subpoena, contending that a sitting president enjoys "absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind."&lt;ref name=TurnOver/&gt; In October 2019, Judge [[Victor Marrero]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] rejected Trump's effort to prevent his tax returns from being turned over to the New York grand jury, and ordered Trump to comply with a subpoena. In a 75-page opinion, the court called Trump's contention an overreach of executive power that is "repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values."&lt;ref name=TurnOver/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDNYDecision&gt;{{cite court|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/07/politics/sdny-ruling-trump-tax-returns/index.html|litigants=Trump v.

Separately, a [[New York law|New York state law]] was enacted in July 2019, authorizing New York state tax officials to release state tax returns, including Trump's, for any "specified and legitimate legislative purpose" to the House Ways and Means Committee and three other congressional committees.&lt;ref name="McKinley2019"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKinley|first1=Jesse|last2=Fandos|first2=Nicholas|title=Cuomo Signs a Bill to Allow Release of Trump's State Tax Returns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/nyregion/trump-ny-taxes-cuomo.html|work=The New York Times|date=8 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump sued the State and the House Ways and Means Committee fifteen days later to block release of the tax returns.&lt;ref name="TrumpSuitNY"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-new-york.html|title=Trump Sues New York and Congress to Shield His State Tax Returns|first1=Nicholas|last1=Fandos|first2=Jesse|last2=McKinley|date=July 23, 2019|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2019, Trump's suit was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.&lt;ref name="Polantz"&gt;Katelyn Polantz, [https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns/index.html Trump can't sue New York state in DC federal court to stop release of tax returns, judge says], CNN (November 11, 2019).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The IRS has stated that nothing prevents an individual from releasing their tax returns; an audit cannot stop the tax return release, and several former leaders of IRS have said that audits are a poor reason to justify not releasing tax returns. In any case, Trump has the ability to put on hold a current audit. Before Trump's election, every elected president from [[Richard Nixon]] onward has released their tax returns annually. While president, Nixon himself released his tax returns despite them being under audit. Also, all major presidential nominees from 1976 onward released their tax returns.&lt;ref name=WaPoBus/&gt;

==Tax figures from 1985 through 1994==
Trump lost $1.17 billion between 1985 and 1994 according to 10 years of Trump's tax information obtained by the ''New York Times'', with the amount more than "nearly any other individual American taxpayer" during that period. Although Trump has acknowledged the tax-advantaged nature of the real estate business due to large depreciation write-offs to generate losses and reduce tax liabilities, the ''Times'' reported "depreciation cannot account for the hundreds of millions of dollars in losses."&lt;ref name="Red"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buettner|first1=Russ|last2=Craig|first2=Susanne|title=Decade in the Red: Trump Tax Figures Show Over $1 Billion in Business Losses|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html|access-date=May 7, 2019|work=The New York Times|date=May 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/us/trump-tax-figures.html|title=5 Takeaways From 10 Years of Trump Tax Figures|last1=Buettner|first1=Russ|last2=Craig|first2=Susanne|date=May 7, 2019|website=The New York Times|access-date=May 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/trump-defends-tax-tactics-after-nyt-story-says-he-racked-up-more-than-1-billion-in-losses-it-was-sport.html|title=Trump defends tax tactics after NYT probe says he racked up more than $1 billion in losses: 'It was sport'|last=Calia|first=Mike|date=May 8, 2019|website=CNBC|access-date=May 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to losing more than $500 million in combined losses, section 172 of the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] gave Trump $915.7 million in tax exemption, which he used to pay off 8 years of taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/us/trump-tax-figures.html|title=5 Takeaways From 10 Years of Trump Tax Figures|last1=Craig|first1=Susanne|last2=Buettner|first2=Russ|date=May 7, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 9, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/2264/text|title=Text - H.R.2264 - 103rd Congress (1993-1994): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|last=Sabo|first=Martin Olav|date=August 10, 1993|publisher=[[Congress.gov]]|access-date=May 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-early-financial-losses-were-so-steep-that-he-did-not-pay-income-taxes-for-eight-years-according-to-new-report/2019/05/07/cb019e4a-7120-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html|title=Trump's early financial losses were so steep that he did not pay income taxes for eight years, according to new report|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|date=May 5, 2019|work=The Washington Post|access-date=May 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published some tax documents from 1995. ''The New York Times'' reported that the ''Times'' had been given three pages of certain state tax returns for Trump for the year 1995. The materials indicated that Trump incurred a $916 million [[net operating loss]] which, for Federal income tax purposes, could have prevented Trump from owing any Federal income taxes for up to 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-times-trump-declared-a-916-million-loss-in-1995-tax-returns/|title=Trump incurrs $916 million loss on his income tax returns|last=Doe|first=John|date=October 1, 2016|publisher=CBS News|access-date=October 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002062654/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-times-trump-declared-a-916-million-loss-in-1995-tax-returns/|archive-date=October 2, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Kasowitz]] of [[Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman]] wrote to the ''Times'' stating, according to one report, that "the publication of Trump's tax records was illegal because Trump had not authorized their disclosure ...

Trump claimed on his tax returns that he lost money, but did not recognize it in the form of canceled debts. Trump might have performed a [[Swap (finance)|stock-for-debt swap]]. This would have allowed Trump to avoid paying [[Income tax in the United States|income taxes]] for at least 18 years. An [[Income tax audit|audit]] of Trump's tax returns for 2002 through 2008 was "closed administratively by agreement with the [[Internal Revenue Service|I.R.S.]] without assessment or payment, on a net basis, of any deficiency." Tax attorneys believe the government may have reduced what Trump was able to claim as a loss without requiring him to pay any additional taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/01/a-big-dirty-secret-from-donald-trumps-tax-returns-has-been-exposed/ "A big, dirty secret from Donald Trump's tax returns has been exposed"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190210192856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/01/a-big-dirty-secret-from-donald-trumps-tax-returns-has-been-exposed/|date=February 10, 2019}}.

On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to [[Rachel Maddow]] and shown on [[MSNBC]]. The document states that Trump had a gross adjusted income of $150&amp;nbsp;million and paid $38&amp;nbsp;million in federal taxes. The White House confirmed the authenticity of these documents and claimed: "Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns."&lt;ref name="nyt-taxes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html|title=Trump Wrote Off $100 Million in Business Losses in 2005|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|author1-link=Peter Baker (journalist)|last2=Drucker|first2=Jesse|last3=Craig|first3=Susanne|author3-link=Susanne Craig|last4=Barstow|first4=David|author4-link=David Barstow|date=March 15, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hill-taxes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/324016-wh-releases-trump-tax-info-ahead-of-msnbc-report-made-150m-in-2005|title=WH releases Trump tax info ahead of MSNBC report: He paid $38M in federal taxes in '05|last=Jagoda|first=Naomi|access-date=March 15, 2017|website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In April 2011, Trump said that when President [[Barack Obama]] produces "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|his birth certificate]] ... I’d love to give my tax returns".

According to Trump's former political adviser [[Sam Nunberg]] said in 2013 and 2014 that Trump had considered the possibility of releasing his tax returns as part of a presidential campaign, believing that showing how little he paid in taxes would make him appear to be a savvy businessman.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;[[Vicky Ward]], [https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/14/politics/trump-originally-wanted-to-release-tax-returns/index.html Trump wanted to release his taxes in 2013 to show how smart he was for paying so little], CNN (October 14, 2019).&lt;/ref&gt; Nunberg said by November 2014, he had persuaded Trump to reverse course and withhold his tax returns, as Trump decided that he "wanted to look rich rather than smart."&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; In May 2014, Trump said in an interview: "If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that."&lt;ref name="FactPence"/&gt;

The IRS commissioner at the time, [[John Koskinen]], said that an IRS audit does not prevent the taxpayer from releasing tax returns.

Trump was criticized for his refusal to release tax information.

During the [[2016 United States presidential debates]], rival presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] criticized Trump, saying that only "a couple of years" of Trump's tax returns were publicly available, "and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax". Trump directly responded: "That makes me smart." Clinton went on to suggest that Trump might not have "paid any federal income tax for a lot of years"; this resulted in Trump saying that the taxes he paid "would be squandered" by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mangan|first=Dan|title=Trump brags about not paying taxes: 'That makes me smart'|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/26/trump-brags-about-not-paying-taxes-that-makes-me-smart.html|publisher=[[CNBC]]|access-date=April 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazars USA]'', No. 19-5142 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 11, 2019).&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings identified four areas that the committee aimed to investigate through the subpoena: (1) whether Trump "may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office"; (2) whether Trump "has undisclosed [[conflicts of interest]] that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions"; (3) whether Trump was complying with the Constitution's [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]] and [[Domestic Emoluments Clause]]; and (4) whether Trump "has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities."&lt;ref name=DCCirDecision/&gt;

On May 10, 2019, Neal, the chairman of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]], issued a separate subpoena to both the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service to hand over six years of President Trump's personal and business tax returns and grant access by May 17.&lt;ref name=WaysMeansSub/&gt; Neal stated that the committee aimed to obtain the tax records to evaluate "the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president."&lt;ref name=WaysMeansSub/&gt;

In a 75-page opinion, the court called Trump's contention an overreach of executive power that is "repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values."&lt;ref name=TurnOver/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDNYDecision/&gt; Enforcement of the subpoena was temporarily delayed pending consideration by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].&lt;ref name=TurnOver/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/politics/trump-tax-returns-lawsuit/index.html|title=Judge dismisses Trump request to keep taxes secret in New York|last=Orden|first=Erica|publisher=CNN|date=October 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same month, [[oral argument]] before the Second Circuit took place before a three-judge panel of Chief Judge [[Robert A. Katzmann]], Judge [[Denny Chin]], and Judge [[Christopher F. Droney]]. Trump's private lawyer, William S. Consovoy, argued that a president enjoyed absolute "presidential immunity" from all investigation and criminal process while in office; responding to a hypothetical from the court, Consovoy said the president should be shielded even if he hypothetically committed murder on [[Fifth Avenue]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=ImmunityClaim&gt;Ann E.

Vance'', [[C-SPAN]], October 23, 2019&lt;/ref&gt; In response, counsel for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office told the court that "there is no such thing as presidential immunity for tax returns" and noted that tax returns are frequently subpoenaed in financial investigations.&lt;ref name=ImmunityClaim/&gt;

On November 4, 2019, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit unanimously ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena and hand over eight years of Trump's tax returns.&lt;ref name=WeiserLiptak/&gt;&lt;ref name=2dCir/&gt; The court held that the president is not immune from "the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce non-privileged material, even when the subject matter under investigation pertains to the President" and that a state grand jury may permissibly issue subpoenas "in aid of its investigation of potential crimes committed by persons within its jurisdiction, even if that investigation may in some way implicate the President."&lt;ref name=2dCir/&gt; Noting that "the President concedes that his immunity lasts only so long as he holds office and that he could therefore be prosecuted after leaving office," the Second Circuit ruled that there "is no obvious reason why a state could not begin to investigate a President during his term and, with the information secured during that search, ultimately determine to prosecute him after he leaves office."&lt;ref name=2dCir/&gt; 

Trump subsequently filed a petition for a [[writ of certiorari]] to the Supreme Court, asserting that the grand-jury subpoena directed to him violates [[Article II of the United States Constitution|Article II]] and the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the Constitution. In December 2019, the Court agreed to hear the appeal, and initially set [[oral arguments]] for March 2020.&lt;ref name=VanceDocket&gt;[https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-vance/ Case Files: ''Trump v.

===Whistleblower complaint regarding interference in mandatory IRS audit process===
On July 29, 2019, a career IRS official filed a whistleblower complaint with the [[House Ways and Means Committee]], [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]], and [[Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration]], stating that at least one [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] official had inappropriately interfered in the audit process for the tax returns of the president and vice president,&lt;ref name=SteinHamburgerDawsey&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jeff Stein|author2=Tom Hamburger|author3=Josh Dawsey|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/irs-whistleblower-said-to-report-treasury-political-appointee-might-have-tried-to-interfere-in-audit-of-trump-or-pence/2019/10/03/0c768b34-e52e-11e9-a331-2df12d56a80b_story.html|title=IRS whistleblower said to report Treasury political appointee might have tried to interfere in audit of Trump or Pence|work=The Washington Post|date=October 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place annually in accordance with IRS policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Naomi Jagoda|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/464469-tax-return-whistleblower-in-spotlight-amid-impeachment-fight|title=Tax-return whistleblower in spotlight amid impeachment fight|work=The Hill|date=October 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility that political appointees interfered with audits conducted by career civil servants alarmed former IRS officials and legal experts.&lt;ref name=SteinHamburgerDawsey/&gt; Due to stringent laws regarding disclosure of tax information, the details of the complaint have not been made public.&lt;ref name=SteinHamburgerDawsey/&gt; However, Representative [[Richard E. Neal]], the Democratic chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in September 2019 that he was consulting legal counsel on whether the whistleblower's complaint could be publicly released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jeff Stein|author2=Tom Hamburger|author3=Josh Dawsey|author4=Colin Wilhelm|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-27/democrat-weighs-releasing-complaint-about-irs-trump-tax-audit|title=Democrat Weighs Releasing Complaint About IRS Trump Tax Audit|work=Bloomberg|date=September 27, 2019}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The whistleblower's report was referred to by Neal and other House Democrats in the federal lawsuit regarding Trump's refusal to comply with a House Ways and Means Committee subpoena for the returns; in a filing, Neal wrote that the whistleblower's complaint presents credible evidence of "potential 'inappropriate efforts to influence' the mandatory audit program" and raises "serious and urgent concerns," thereby bolsters the committee's case for obtaining the tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lorenzo|first1=Aaron|title=House Democrats say bolsters case for getting Trump's tax returns|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/20/tax-democrats-trump-1673427|access-date=October 1, 2019|work=[[Politico]]|date=August 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veracity and politics==

"It has long been a [[truism]] that politicians lie", wrote Carole McGranahan for the ''[[American Ethnologist]]'' journal in 2017. However, "Donald Trump is different" from other politicians, stated McGranahan, citing that Trump is the most "accomplished and effective liar" thus far to have ever participated in American politics. McGranahan felt that "the frequency, degree, and impact of lying in politics are now unprecedented" as a result of Trump.&lt;ref name="McGranahan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McGranahan |first=Carole |title=An anthropology of lying: Trump and the political sociality of moral outrage |journal=[[American Ethnologist]] |date=May 2017 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=243–248 |doi=10.1111/amet.12475 |quote=It has long been a truism that politicians lie, but with the entry of Donald Trump into the U.S. political domain, the frequency, degree, and impact of lying in politics are now unprecedented [...] Donald Trump is different. By all metrics and counting schemes, his lies are off the charts. We simply have not seen such an accomplished and effective liar before in U.S. politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Presidential historian [[Douglas Brinkley]] of Rice University stated that past U.S. presidents have indeed "lied or misled the country", but none of them were a "serial liar" like Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=December 22, 2017 |first=Daniel |last=Dale |authorlink=Daniel Dale |title=Donald Trump has spent a year lying shamelessly.

But Trump is a whole different animal", because Trump "lies as a policy", and he "will say anything" to satisfy his supporters or himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Donnel |title=Constructivism in the Age of Trump: Truth, Lies, and Knowing the Difference |journal=Psychoanalytic Dialogues |date=May 9, 2019 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=189–196 |doi=10.1080/10481885.2019.1587996 |quote=Donald Trump lies so often that some have wondered whether he has [[poisoned the well]] [...] We expect politicians to stretch the truth. But Trump is a whole different animal. He lies as a policy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidi Taksdal Skjeseth, writing for the [[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]] in 2017, described lies having "always been an integral part of politics and political communication". However, Trump was "delivering untruths on an unprecedented scale" in U.S. politics, both during his presidential campaign and during his presidency. Skjeseth also commented that no one in French politics was comparable to Trump in his provision of falsehoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]] |date=2017 |first=Heidi Taksdal |last=Skjeseth |title=All the president's lies: Media coverage of lies in the US and France |url=https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2017-10/Taksdal%20Skjeseth%2C%20All%20the%20President%27s%20Lies%20-%20Media%20Coverage%20of%20lies%20in%20the%20US%20and%20France.pdf |quote=... a president who is delivering untruths on an unprecedented scale. Mr Trump did this both while running for president, and he has continued to do so in office. There is no precedent for this amount of untruths in the US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fabrications have long been a part of American politics", wrote [[Sheryl Gay Stolberg]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2017, as several presidents in the previous 50 years have lied. Stolberg cited that [[Dwight Eisenhower]] lied about [[1960 U-2 incident|a U.S. spy plane shot down over the Soviet Union]], [[Lyndon Johnson]] lied to justify [[Vietnam War#Johnson's escalation, 1963–1969|U.S. policies regarding Vietnam]], and [[Bill Clinton]] lied to [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|conceal his sexual affair]]. Meanwhile, Stolberg recounts that [[Richard Nixon]] was accused of lying in the [[Watergate scandal]], while [[George W. Bush]] was accused of lying about the need for the [[Iraq War]] (with Donald Trump being one accuser of Bush lying). However, Stolberg states that "President Trump, historians and consultants in both political parties agree, appears to have taken what the writer [[Hannah Arendt]] once called 'the conflict between truth and politics' to an entirely new level ... Trump is trafficking in hyperbole, distortion and fabrication on practically a daily basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 7, 2017 |first=Sheryl Gay |last=Stolberg |authorlink=Sheryl Gay Stolberg |title=Many Politicians Lie.

Mark Barabak of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has described in 2017 that U.S. presidents "of all stripes" have previously misled the public, either accidentally or "very purposefully". Barabak provided examples of [[Ronald Reagan]], who falsely stated that he had filmed [[Nazi death camps]], and [[Barack Obama]], who falsely stated that "if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it" under his [[Affordable Care Act]]. However, Barabak goes on to state that "White House scholars and other students of government agree there has never been a president like Donald Trump, whose volume of falsehoods, misstatements and serial exaggerations" are unparalleled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barabak |first1=Mark |title=There’s a long history of presidential untruths.

==Business career==

Within years of expanding [[The Trump Organization|his father's property development business]] into [[Manhattan]] in the early 1970s, Trump attracted the attention of ''[[The New York Times]]'' for his brash and controversial style, with one real estate financier observing in 1976, "His deals are dramatic, but they haven't come into being. So far, the chief beneficiary of his creativity has been his public image." [[Der Scutt]], the prominent architect who designed [[Trump Tower]], said of Trump in 1976, "He's extremely aggressive when he sells, maybe to the point of overselling. Like, he'll say the convention center is the biggest in the world, when it really isn't. He'll exaggerate for the purpose of making a sale."&lt;ref name="Klemesrud"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 1, 1976 |first=Judy |last=Klemesrud |authorlink=Judy Lee Klemesrud |title=Donald Trump, Real Estate Promoter, Builds Image as He Buys Buildings |accessdate=October 23, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/01/archives/donald-trump-real-estate-promoter-builds-image-as-he-buys-buildings.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017203902/https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/01/archives/donald-trump-real-estate-promoter-builds-image-as-he-buys-buildings.html |archive-date=October 17, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect [[Philip Johnson]] said in 1984 that Trump often lied, adding "But it's sheer exuberance, exaggeration.

When the stock market [[Black Monday (1987)|crashed in October 1987]], Trump told the press he had sold all his stock a month before and taken no losses.

On September 11, 2001, after at least one of the World Trade Center towers were destroyed, Trump gave a telephone interview with [[WWOR-TV]] in New York.

At a rally in [[Columbus, Ohio]], in November 2015, Trump said "I have a view&amp;mdash;a view in my apartment that was specifically aimed at the World Trade Center."  He added "and I watched those people jump and I watched the second plane hit ... I saw the second plane hit the building and I said, 'Wow that's unbelievable."

Trump claimed repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2015 that the actual unemployment rate of around 5% "isn't reflective [of reality]{{nbsp}}...

Jeremy Adam Smith, writing for the ''[[Greater Good Magazine]]'', said Trump's falsehoods may be "blue lies", which are "told on behalf of a group, that can actually strengthen the bonds among the members of that group".

In November 2015, [[Buzzfeed News]]' Andrew Kaczynski reported that Trump, despite having claimed to have the best memory in the world, actually has a history of "conveniently forgetting" people or organizations in ways that benefit him.

[[Tony Burman]] wrote: "The falsehoods and distortions uttered by Trump and his senior officials have particularly inflamed journalists and have been challenged—resulting in a growing prominence of 'fact-checkers' and investigative reporting."&lt;ref name="Burman_2/11/2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Burman |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Burman |date=February 11, 2017 |title=With Trump, the media faces a yuuge challenge |website=[[Toronto Star]] |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/02/11/with-trump-the-media-faces-a-yuuge-challenge.html |accessdate=February 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211213020/https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/02/11/with-trump-the-media-faces-a-yuuge-challenge.html |archive-date=February 11, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation is getting worse, as described by [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist [[Ashley Parker]]: "President Trump seems to be saying more and more things that aren't true."&lt;ref name="Parker_6/19/2018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Ashley |authorlink=Ashley Parker |title=President Trump seems to be saying more and more things that aren't true |website=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 19, 2018 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-trump-seems-to-be-saying-more-and-more-things-that-arent-true/2018/06/19/c1bb8af6-73d5-11e8-805c-4b67019fcfe4_story.html |access-date=August 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823033443/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-trump-seems-to-be-saying-more-and-more-things-that-arent-true/2018/06/19/c1bb8af6-73d5-11e8-805c-4b67019fcfe4_story.html |archive-date=August 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]] said in 2017 that in his job as a fact-checker for ''The Washington Post'' there was no comparison between Trump and other politicians. Kessler gave his worst rating to other politicians 15 percent to 20 percent of the time, but gave it to Trump 63 percent to 65 percent of the time.&lt;ref name="Milbank_7/1/2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-facts-behind-donald-trumps-many-falsehoods/2016/08/01/0571b048-582d-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html|title=The facts behind Donald Trump's many falsehoods|last=Milbank|first=Dana|date=August 1, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=April 2, 2018|authorlink=Dana Milbank|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412151143/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-facts-behind-donald-trumps-many-falsehoods/2016/08/01/0571b048-582d-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html|archive-date=April 12, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kessler wrote that Trump was the most fact-challenged politician that he had ever encountered and lamented that "the pace and volume of the president's misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up".&lt;ref name="Kessler_Lee_5/1/2017"/&gt;

''The Washington Post'' fact-checker created a new category of falsehoods in December 2018, the "Bottomless Pinocchio", for falsehoods repeated at least twenty times (so often "that there can be no question the politician is aware his or her facts are wrong"). Trump was the only politician who met the standard of the category, with 14 statements that immediately qualified. According to the ''[[Washington Post]],'' Trump has repeated some falsehoods so many times he has effectively engaged in [[disinformation]].&lt;ref name="Kessler_12/10/2018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kessler |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |title=Meet the Bottomless Pinocchio, a new rating for a false claim repeated over and over again |website=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 10, 2018 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/ |access-date=January 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118132341/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/ |archive-date=January 18, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Robert Prentice summarized the views of many fact-checkers:
{{quote|Here's the problem: As fact checker Glenn Kessler noted in August, whereas Clinton lies as much as the average politician, President Donald Trump's lying is "off the charts." No prominent politician in memory bests Trump for spouting spectacular, egregious, easily disproved lies. The birther claim. The vote fraud claim. The attendance at the inauguration claim. And on and on and on. Every fact checker—Kessler, Factcheck.org, Snopes.com, PolitiFact—finds a level of mendacity unequaled by any politician ever scrutinized. For instance, 70 percent of his campaign statements checked by PolitiFact were mostly false, totally false, or "pants on fire" false.&lt;ref name="Prentice_2/10/2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Prentice |first=Robert |date=February 10, 2017 |title=Being a liar doesn't mean you can't be a good president, but this is crazy |website=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/02/10/liar-mean-good-president-crazy |accessdate=February 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212183638/http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/02/10/liar-mean-good-president-crazy |archive-date=February 12, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of 2018, Kessler provided a run-down summary of Trump's accelerating rate of false statements during the year:
{{quote|Trump began 2018 on a similar pace as last year. Through May, he generally averaged about 200 to 250 false claims a month. But his rate suddenly exploded in June, when he topped 500 falsehoods, as he appeared to shift to campaign mode. He uttered almost 500 more in both July and August, almost 600 in September, more than 1,200 in October and almost 900 in November. In December, Trump drifted back to the mid-200s.&lt;ref name="Kessler_12/30/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kessler | first=Glenn | title=A year of unprecedented deception: Trump averaged 15 false claims a day in 2018 | website=[[The Washington Post]] | date=December 30, 2018 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/30/year-unprecedented-deception-trump-averaged-false-claims-day/ | access-date=February 20, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219213324/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/30/year-unprecedented-deception-trump-averaged-false-claims-day/ | archive-date=February 19, 2019 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As late as summer 2018, the news media were debating whether to use the word "lie" to describe Trump's falsehoods. However, by June 2019, many news organizations, including [[CNN]], ''[[Star Tribune]],'' ''[[Financial Times]],'' ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' ''[[Chicago Tribune]],'' ''[[The New Yorker]],'' and ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' had started describing some of Trump's false statements as lies. The ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' was one of the first outlets to use the word "lie" to describe Trump's statements, and continues to do so frequently. Still, some organizations have continued to shy away from the term. [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]], author of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' 's "Fact Checker" column, has used the word ''lie'' only once to describe Trump's statements, although he has sometimes used other terminology that implies lying.&lt;ref name=lies/&gt;

As of October 9, 2019, ''The Washington Post''{{'}}s fact-checking team has documented that Trump has "made 13,435 false or misleading claims over 993 days".&lt;ref name="Kessler_Rizzo_Kelly_10/14/2019"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Kessler | first1=Glenn | last2=Rizzo | first2=Salvador | last3=Kelly | first3=Meg | title=President Trump has made 13,435 false or misleading claims over 993 days | website=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 14, 2019 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/ | access-date=October 14, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014095848/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/ | archive-date=October 14, 2019 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2019, the ''Washington Post'' Fact Checker newsletter summed up the situation:

''Washington Post'' commentator Greg Sargent pointed out eight instances where government officials either repeated lies or came up with misleading information to support falsehoods asserted by Trump,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/05/not-just-sharpie-gate-other-times-officials-tried-fabricate-trumps-truth/ |title=Not just Sharpie-gate: 7 other times officials tried to fabricate Trump's 'truth' |work=The Washington Post |date=September 5, 2019 |access-date=November 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117001423/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/05/not-just-sharpie-gate-other-times-officials-tried-fabricate-trumps-truth/ |archive-date=November 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; including various false claims about terrorists crossing or attempting to cross the Mexican border, that a 10% middle class tax cut had been passed, and a doctored video justifying Jim Acosta's removal from the White House press room.

James P. Pfiffner, writing for The Evolving American Presidency book series, wrote that compared to previous presidents, Trump tells "vastly" more "conventional lies" that politicians usually tell to avoid criticism or improve their image. However, Pfiffner emphasized that "the most significant" lies told by Trump are instead "egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well-known facts", because by causing disagreements about what the facts are, then people cannot properly evaluate their government: "Political power rather than rational discourse then becomes the arbiter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pfiffner |first1=James |title=Presidential Leadership and the Trump Presidency |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-3-030-18979-2 |page=17–40 |chapter=The Lies of Donald Trump: A Taxonomy|year=2020 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-18979-2_2 |url=https://pfiffner.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pfiffner-The-Lies-of-Donald-Trump-A-Taxonomy.pdf |accessdate=May 29, 2020 |quote=This chapter will document some of President Trump’s “conventional” lies similar to those that politicians often tell in order to look good or escape blame; the number of these types of lies by Trump vastly exceeds those of previous presidents. But the most significant Trump lies are egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well-known facts. If there are no agreed upon facts, then it becomes impossible for people to make judgments about their government. Political power rather than rational discourse then becomes the arbiter. Agreement on facts, of course, does not imply agreement on policies or politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selman Özdan, writing in the journal ''Postdigital Science and Education'', describes that "many" of Trump's statements in interviews or on Twitter "may now be classed as bullshit", with their utter disregard for the truth, and their focus on telling "a version of reality that suits Trump's aims". These statements are "often" written in a way which criticizes or mocks others, while offering a misleading version of Trump's accomplishments to improve his image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Özdan |first1=Selman |title=Subverting the Art of Diplomacy: Bullshit, Lies and Trump |journal=Postdigital Science and Education |date=October 1, 2019 |volume=2 |pages=95–112 |doi=10.1007/s42438-019-00075-6 |quote=Many of Trump’s tweets or statements delivered via interviews may now be classed as bullshit since they are not knowledgeable, are ignorant and deceptive: they show no concern for the facts or the truth, only for a version of reality that suits Trump’s aims.

====Special Counsel Investigation====
In March 2019, Trump asserted that the special counsel investigation is "illegal"; previously in June 2018, Trump argued that "the appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!". However, in August 2018, [[Dabney L. Friedrich|Dabney Friedrich]], a Trump-appointed judge on the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|DC District Court]] ruled the appointment was constitutional, as did a unanimous three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit]] in February 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/politics/fact-check-trump-says-mueller-investigation-is-illegal/index.html |title=Fact-check: Trump claims Mueller investigation 'illegal', ignoring multiple court rulings |first1=Holmes |last1=Lybrand |first2=Marshall |last2=Cohen |publisher=CNN |access-date=March 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322211918/https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/politics/fact-check-trump-says-mueller-investigation-is-illegal/index.html |archive-date=March 22, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dukakis |first1=Ali |title=Appeals court says special counsel Robert Mueller 'properly appointed'; orders ex-Stone aide to testify |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-mueller-properly-appointed-orders-stone-aide/story?id=61327058 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=23 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085953/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-mueller-properly-appointed-orders-stone-aide/story?id=61327058 |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mueller Report]]'' asserted Trump's family members, campaign staff, Republican backers, administration officials, and his associates lied or made false assertions, with the plurality of lies from Trump himself (mostly while he was president), whether unintentional or not, to the public, Congress, or authorities, per a CNN analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/politics/mueller-report-trump-team-lies-falsehoods/index.html |title=The Mueller report: A catalog of 77 Trump team lies and falsehoods |first1=Katelyn |last1=Polantz |first2=Marshall |last2=Cohen |date=April 30, 2019 |website=CNN.com |access-date=May 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509164606/https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/politics/mueller-report-trump-team-lies-falsehoods/index.html |archive-date=May 9, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2019, following the release of Attorney General [[Barr letter|William Barr's summary]] of the [[Mueller Report|findings of the completed special counsel investigation]], Trump tweeted: "No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION". However, Barr had quoted special counsel Mueller as writing that "while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him" on whether he had committed obstruction of justice. Barr declined to bring an obstruction of justice charge against the President. In testimony to Congress in May 2019, Barr said he "didn't exonerate" Trump on obstruction as that was not the role of the Justice Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hernandez |first1=Laura |title=Trump sees a 'complete and total exoneration' |url=https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/trump-mueller-investigation-1.28918759 |work=[[Newsday]] |accessdate=25 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325100632/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/trump-mueller-investigation-1.28918759 |archive-date=March 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Allan |title=Justice Department's findings a 'complete and total exoneration', Trump responds |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/justice-department-s-findings-total-complete-exoneration-white-house-responds-n986756 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=25 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325052843/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/justice-department-s-findings-total-complete-exoneration-white-house-responds-n986756 |archive-date=March 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APMay1Test"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Day |first1=Chad |title=Key takeaways from AG Barr's testimony, Mueller's letter |url=https://apnews.com/ec455a7ba1c846deaf8a2616f7754698 |date=May 2, 2019 |website=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=May 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501235425/https://apnews.com/ec455a7ba1c846deaf8a2616f7754698 |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2019, Trump's most repeated falsehoods, each repeated during his presidency more than a hundred times, were that a U.S. [[trade deficit]] would be a "loss" for the country, that his [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|tax cuts]] were the largest in American history, that the economy was the strongest ever during his administration, and that the [[Trump wall|wall]] was already being built. By August, he had made this last claim at least 190 times. He has also made 100 false claims about NATO spending, whether on the part of the United States or other NATO members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kessler |first1=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |last2=Fox |first2=Joe |title=The false claims that Trump keeps repeating |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/fact-checker-most-repeated-disinformation |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=10 September 2019 |quote=updated 5 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219130403/https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/fact-checker-most-repeated-disinformation/ |archive-date=February 19, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump claimed during the campaign that the U.S. real GDP could grow at rate of "5 or even 6" percent under his policies. During 2018, the economy grew at 2.9%, the same rate as 2015 under President Obama. Longer-term projections beyond 2019 by the CBO and Federal Reserve are for growth below 2%. President Obama's advisers explained growth limits as "sluggish worker productivity and shrinking labor supply as baby boomers retire".&lt;ref name="CNBC1"&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/trumps-economic-policies-failed-to-deliver-promised-3percent-growth-in-2018.html "Trump and GOP promised economic growth much better than Obama's.

Trump claimed in October 2017 he would eliminate the federal debt over eight years, even though it was $19 trillion at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1418/eliminate-federal-debt-8-years/ "Eliminate the federal debt in 8 years"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512214648/https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1418/eliminate-federal-debt-8-years/ |date=May 12, 2019 }}, Politifact, October 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; However, the annual deficit (debt addition) in 2018 was nearly $800 billion, about 60% higher than the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] forecast of $500 billion when Trump took office. The CBO January 2019 forecast for the 2018–2027 debt addition is now 40% higher, at $13.0 trillion rather than $9.4 trillion when Trump was inaugurated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54918 "Budget and Economic Outlook 2019 to 2029"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504032538/https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54918 |date=May 4, 2019 }}, CBO, January 28, 2019&lt;/ref&gt; Other forecasts place the debt addition over a decade at $16 trillion, bringing the total to around $35 trillion. Rather than a debt to GDP ratio in 2028 of 89% had Obama's policies continued, CBO now estimates this figure at 107%, assuming Trump's tax cuts for individuals are extended past 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/opinion/trump-2018-charts.html |first=Steven |last=Rattner |authorlink=Steven Rattner |title=2018 The Year in Charts |date=December 31, 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=May 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512023134/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/opinion/trump-2018-charts.html |archive-date=May 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has sought to present his economic policies as successful in encouraging businesses to invest in new facilities and create jobs. In this effort, he has on several occasions taken credit for business investments that began before he became president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/30/trump-keeps-taking-credit-for-deals-struck-while-obama-was-president.html|title=Trump keeps taking credit for deals struck while Obama was president|first=David|last=Mack|date=March 30, 2017|website=CNBC|access-date=August 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816002832/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/30/trump-keeps-taking-credit-for-deals-struck-while-obama-was-president.html|archive-date=August 16, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/fact-check-trump-takes-credit-for-another-factory-approved-under-obama/index.html|title=Fact check: Trump takes credit for another factory approved under Obama|first=Daniel|last=Dale|website=CNN|access-date=August 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816033053/https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/fact-check-trump-takes-credit-for-another-factory-approved-under-obama/index.html|archive-date=August 16, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has repeatedly claimed that China or Chinese exporters were bearing the [[Trump tariffs|burden of his tariffs]], not Americans, a claim Politifact has rated as "false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/14/donald-trump/does-china-mostly-pay-us-tariffs-rather-us-consume/|title=Who pays for US tariffs on Chinese goods?

For example, CBO reported in January 2020 that: "Tariffs are expected to reduce the level of [U.S.] real GDP by roughly 0.5 percent and raise consumer prices by 0.5 percent in 2020. As a result, tariffs are also projected to reduce average real household income by $1,277 (in 2019 dollars) in 2020."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56020|title=The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030 |date=January 28, 2020 |work=cbo.gov |access-date=March 20, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Trump has argued that tariffs would reduce the trade deficit, it expanded to a record dollar level in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-trump-trade-deficit-20190306-story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=David |last=Lynch |title=Trump promised to shrink the U.S. trade deficit.

====Family separation policy====

{{see also|Trump administration family separation policy}}

President Trump has repeatedly and falsely said he inherited [[Trump administration family separation policy|his administration's family separation policy]] from Obama, his predecessor. In November 2018, Trump said, "President Obama separated children from families, and all I did was take the same law, and then I softened the law." In April 2019, Trump said, "President Obama separated children. They had child separation; I was the one that changed it." In June 2019, Trump said, "President Obama had a separation policy. I didn't have it. He had it. I brought the families together. I'm the one that put them together{{nbsp}}... I inherited separation, and I changed the plan". Trump's assertion was false because the Obama administration had no policy systematically separating migrant families, while "zero tolerance" was not instituted until April 2018. [[PolitiFact]] quoted immigration experts saying that under the Obama administration families were detained and released together and separations rarely happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flaherty |first1=Anne |title=Trump falsely blames Obama for family separations at border |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-falsely-blames-obama-family-separations-border/story?id=58908866 |website=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=July 2, 2019 |date=November 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727145345/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-falsely-blames-obama-family-separations-border/story?id=58908866 |archive-date=July 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montoya-Galvez |first1=Camilo |title=In misleading claim, Trump accuses Obama of separating migrant children |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-blames-obama-for-child-separation-policy-claim-review/ |website=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=July 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801023437/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-blames-obama-for-child-separation-policy-claim-review/ |archive-date=August 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Valverde |first1=Miriam |title=Donald Trump, again, falsely says Obama had family separation policy |url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/jun/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-again-falsely-says-obama-had-family-s/ |website=[[Politifact]] |accessdate=July 2, 2019 |date=July 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703191944/https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/jun/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-again-falsely-says-obama-had-family-s/ |archive-date=July 3, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Article II and unlimited executive power====
In July 2019, during a speech addressing youth at Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit in Washington, ''The Washington Post'' reported that, while criticizing the [[Mueller investigation]], Trump falsely claimed [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]] ensures, "I have to the right to do whatever I want as president". The ''Post'' clarified that "Article{{nbsp}}II grants the president 'executive power'. It does not indicate the president has [[Autocracy|total power]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brice-Saddler |first1=Michael |title=While bemoaning Mueller probe, Trump falsely says the Constitution gives him 'the right to do whatever I want' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/23/trump-falsely-tells-auditorium-full-teens-constitution-gives-him-right-do-whatever-i-want/ |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=July 24, 2019 |date=July 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723232645/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/23/trump-falsely-tells-auditorium-full-teens-constitution-gives-him-right-do-whatever-i-want/ |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Hurricane Dorian]] approached the Atlantic coast in late August 2019, Trump presented himself as closely monitoring the situation, tweeting extensively about it as ''The New York Times'' reported he was "assuming the role of meteorologist in chief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/us/politics/trump-dorian.html|title=President Trump, Weatherman: Dorian Updates and at Least 122 Tweets|first=Katie|last=Rogers|date=September 2, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905210226/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/us/politics/trump-dorian.html|archive-date=September 5, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, Trump tweeted that Alabama, among other states, "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated" by Dorian.&lt;ref name="2019-09-01_DJT"&gt;{{cite tweet|url=https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1168174613827899393 |title=In addition to Florida – South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.

On September 4 in the Oval Office, Trump displayed a modified version of an August 29 diagram by the National Hurricane Center of the projected track of Dorian. The modification was done with a black marker and extended the [[cone of uncertainty]] of the hurricane's possible path into southern Alabama. Modifying official government weather forecasts is illegal in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/why-does-trump-s-hurricane-map-look-different-others-n1049711|title=Why does Trump's hurricane map look different than others?|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905012606/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/why-does-trump-s-hurricane-map-look-different-others-n1049711|archive-date=September 5, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/trump-hurricane-dorian-alabama-sharpie-map|title=Trump shows fake hurricane map in apparent bid to validate incorrect tweet|last1=Smith|first1=David|date=4 September 2019|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=2019-09-05|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905042857/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/trump-hurricane-dorian-alabama-sharpie-map|archive-date=September 5, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/09/04/president-trump-shows-doctored-hurricane-chart-was-it-cover-up-alabama-twitter-flub|title=President Trump showed a doctored hurricane chart.

On September 5, after Fox News correspondent [[John Roberts (journalist)|John Roberts]] reported about the story live from the White House, Trump summoned him to the Oval Office. Roberts later characterized Trump as "just looking for acknowledgment that he was not wrong for saying that at some point, Alabama was at risk—even if the situation had changed by the time he issued the tweet".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/05/politics/donald-trump-alabama-fox-news-white-house/index.html|title=Trump called Fox News correspondent into Oval Office to argue he wasn't wrong about Alabama|first=Jake|last=Tapper|website=CNN|access-date=September 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906001524/https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/05/politics/donald-trump-alabama-fox-news-white-house/index.html|archive-date=September 6, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, Trump's [[Homeland Security Advisor]] Peter Brown issued a statement asserting Trump had been provided a graphic on September{{nbsp}}1 showing tropical storm force winds touching the southeastern corner of Alabama; a White House source told CNN that Trump had personally instructed Brown to issue the statement.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On September 6, at Trump's direction, acting White House chief of staff [[Mick Mulvaney]] told Commerce secretary [[Wilbur Ross]] to order acting [[NOAA]] administrator Neil Jacobs to fix the contradiction by Birmingham NWS, and Ross threatened to fire top NOAA officials if he did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/09/11/lawmakers-commerce-department-launch-investigations-into-noaas-decision-back-presidents-trump-over-forecasters |title=President Trump pushed staff to deal with NOAA tweet that contradicted his inaccurate Alabama hurricane claim |date=September 11, 2019 |website=Washington Post |access-date=September 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911194008/https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/09/11/lawmakers-commerce-department-launch-investigations-into-noaas-decision-back-presidents-trump-over-forecasters/ |archive-date=September 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/us/politics/trump-alabama-noaa.html|title=White House Pressed Agency to Repudiate Weather Forecasters Who Contradicted Trump|first1=Peter|last1=Baker|authorlink=Peter Baker (journalist)|first2=Lisa|last2=Friedman|first3=Christopher|last3=Flavelle|date=September 11, 2019|website=NYTimes.com|access-date=September 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911165812/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/us/politics/trump-alabama-noaa.html|archive-date=September 11, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, while discussing his own response to the pandemic, Trump falsely suggested that in late February, Dr Anthony Fauci had said that the American coronavirus outbreak was "no problem" and was "going to blow over". Contrary to Trump's claims, Fauci had said in a February 29 interview that "now the risk is still low, but this could change ... You've got to watch out because although the risk is low now ... when you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread ... this could be a major outbreak." Also on February 29, Fauci had stressed during a press conference that "we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Farley |first1=Robert |title=Trump Misquotes Fauci on Coronavirus Threat |url=https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trump-misquotes-fauci-on-coronavirus-threat/ |accessdate=June 1, 2020 |work=[[Factcheck.org]] |date=April 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Obamagate====
On May 10, 2020—one day after former president [[Barack Obama]] criticized the Trump administration's handling of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]]&lt;ref name = understand&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/obamagate-birtherism-all-over-again/611692/|title=How to Understand 'Obamagate'|last=Graham|first=David A.|date=May 15, 2020|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=18 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Trump posted a one-word tweet: "OBAMAGATE!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pengelly |first1=Martin |title=Trump claims Obama committed 'biggest political crime in American history' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn |accessdate=May 29, 2020 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, Trump was asked by [[Philip Rucker]] of ''The Washington Post'' what crime former president Barack Obama committed, but did not give a proper answer. Trump's reply was that: "Obamagate. It's been going on for a long time ... from before I even got elected ... some terrible things happened". When Rucker again asked what the crime was, Trump said: "You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody.

In a May 2020 op-ed at the news website [[RealClearPolitics]], [[Charles Lipson]], professor emeritus of political science at the [[University of Chicago]] analyzed the content of "Obamagate". He claimed that the concept refers to three accusations: (1) The Obama administration conducted [[Mass surveillance in the United States|mass surveillance]] through the NSA; (2) the Obama administration used surveillance against Trump's 2016 presidental campaign, and (3) the Obama administration did not transfer power seamlessly to the new Trump administration. Lipson further claimed that "these abuses didn’t simply follow each other; their targets, goals, and principal players overlapped. Taken together, they represent some of the gravest violations of constitutional norms and legal protections in American history".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/05/27/what_the_obamagate_scandals_mean_and_why_they_matter.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] (AP) in May 2020 addressed Obamagate in a fact check, stating that there was "no evidence" of Trump's suggestion that "the disclosure of Flynn's name as part of legal U.S. surveillance of foreign targets was criminal and motivated by partisan politics." AP stated that there is not only "nothing illegal about unmasking", but also that the unmasking of Flynn was approved using the National Security Agency's "standard process." Unmasking is allowed if officials feel that it is needed to understand the collected intelligence. AP further pointed out that the Trump administration was conducting even more unmasking than the Obama administration in the final year of Obama's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yen |first1=Hope |last2=Tucker |first2=Eric |last3=Perrone |first3=Matthew |title=AP FACT CHECK: Trump, GOP distortion on Flynn; virus fiction |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://apnews.com/b33bb0fac204009a84f4431da6cfd4f3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joe Scarborough murder conspiracy theory====

====Advances for black Americans====

In 2020, Trump had claimed multiple times that he or his administration has "done more for the black community than any president", in some cases compared to all presidents, and in other cases to all presidents "since [[Abraham Lincoln]]" (who [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolished slavery]] in the United States). Prominent historians instead pointed to [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] as the president who did most for the black community since Lincoln, for his [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and his [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. The historians also highlighted that the presidencies of [[Harry Truman]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Barack Obama]] had done much for the black community.

'''''Lawfare''''' is a [[blog]] dedicated to [[national security]] issues, published by the Lawfare Institute in cooperation with the [[Brookings Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/|title=Lawfare|website=Lawfare|language=en|access-date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/how-lawfare-hit-the-big-time.html|title=How a Wonky National-Security Blog Hit the Big Time|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|date=March 14, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has received attention for articles on [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump's presidency]].

== Background ==
The blog was started in September 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/about-lawfare-brief-history-term-and-site|title=About Lawfare: A Brief History of the Term and the Site|date=May 14, 2015|work=Lawfare|access-date=June 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Benjamin Wittes]] (a former editorial writer for ''[[The Washington Post]]''), [[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Jack Goldsmith]], and [[University of Texas School of Law|University of Texas at Austin]] law professor [[Robert M. Chesney|Robert Chesney]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Goldsmith was the head of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] in the [[George W. Bush administration]]'s [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], and Chesney served on a detention-policy task force in the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its writers include law professors, law students, and former [[George W.

== Donald Trump ==

''Lawfare''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s coverage of [[Intelligence analysis|intelligence]] and [[Judiciary|legal matters]] related to the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] has brought the blog significant increases in readership and national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/05/26/ben-wittes-lawfare-blog/|title=This blog has become required reading in Trump's America|last=Abbruzzese|first=Jason|date=May 26, 2017|website=Mashable|access-date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.utexas.edu/news/2017/05/30/chesneys-lawfare-blog-makes-headlines-reaches-10-million-people-a-year/|title=Chesney's Lawfare Blog Makes Headlines, Reaches 10 Million People a Year|date=May 30, 2017|website=The University of Texas at Austin School of Law|language=en-us|access-date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the website's traffic was up by 1,101% from 12 months before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lawfareblog.com/note-readers-new-and-old|title=A Note to Readers New and Old|last=Wittes|first=Benjamin|date=February 2, 2017|work=Lawfare|access-date=June 29, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Executive Order 13769 ===
{{Main|Executive Order 13769|Reactions to Executive Order 13769}}

The blog came to prominence in January 2017 when [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] tweeted "LAWFARE" and quoted a line from one of its blog posts that criticized the reasoning in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruling that blocked Trump's [[Executive Order 13769|first refugee-and-travel ban]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-react-9th-circuit-ruling-travel-ban-234892|title=Trump quotes legal blog to argue travel ban ruling is 'a disgraceful decision'|work=Politico|access-date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/10/donald-trump-travel/97735996/|title=Trump rips 'disgraceful' court decision in immigration ban|work=USA TODAY|access-date=March 14, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump reportedly tweeted the excerpt minutes after the line was quoted on ''[[Morning Joe]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Wittes, who supported the court ruling, criticized Trump harshly for the tweet, asserting that Trump distorted the argument presented in the article.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Wittes also wrote that it was disturbing that Trump, among other things, cited the line "with apparently no idea who the author was or what the publication was, and indeed without reading the rest of the article", and that no one in the [[White House Office|White House]] vetted the tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/thoughts-strange-day%E2%80%94and-very-strange-presidential-tweet|title=Thoughts on a Strange Day—and a Very Strange Presidential Tweet|work=Lawfare|access-date=March 14, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dismissal of FBI Director James Comey ===
{{Main|Dismissal of James Comey}}
On May 18, 2017, ''Lawfare''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes was the principal source of an extensive ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report about President Trump's interactions with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Director]] [[James Comey]], and how those interactions related to [[Dismissal of James Comey|Comey's subsequent firing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/us/politics/james-comey-memo-fbi-trump.html|title=Comey, Unsettled by Trump, Is Said to Have Wanted Him Kept at a Distance|last=Schmidt|first=Michael S.|date=May 18, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 19, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittes also provided a 25-minute interview to ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' on the same subject.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/comey-disgusted-trump-hug-considered-white-house-not-honorable-friend-says/|title=Comey 'disgusted' by Trump hug, considered White House 'not honorable,' friend says|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=May 19, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comey had reportedly been "disgusted" with Trump's attempts to be chummy with Comey and publicly indicate a close relationship with Comey and compromise Comey, such as hugging him, because Comey saw these as calculated attempts to compromise him by agitating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Comey had also reportedly found that people in the Trump administration were "not honorable".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Wittes elaborated on this shortly thereafter in a post on ''Lawfare''.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-james-comey-told-me-about-donald-trump|title=What James Comey Told Me About Donald Trump|date=May 18, 2017|work=Lawfare|access-date=May 19, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trump's disclosure of classified intelligence ===
{{Main|Donald Trump's disclosure of classified information to Russia}}
In a widely read column, several ''Lawfare'' contributors argued that Trump's [[Donald Trump's disclosure of classified information to Russia|reported disclosure of classified intelligence to Russia]] in mid-May 2017 was "perhaps the gravest allegation of presidential misconduct in the scandal-ridden four months of the Trump administration."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/bombshell-initial-thoughts-washington-posts-game-changing-story|title=Bombshell: Initial Thoughts on the Washington Post's Game-Changing Story|date=May 15, 2017|work=Lawfare|access-date=May 19, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/right-and-left-react-to-trumps-sharing-classified-information-with-russia-and-more.html|title=Right and Left React to Trump's Sharing Classified Information With Russia, and More|last=Dubenko|first=Anna|date=May 16, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 19, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/national-security-experts-consequence-of-trump-russia-classified-info-2017-5?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=National security experts: Trump's sharing classified info with Russia 'may breach his oath of office'|work=Business Insider|access-date=May 19, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The column further alleged that Trump's reported actions "may well be a violation of the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|President's oath of office]]."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Journalist [[David Ignatius]] described ''Lawfare'' as "one of the most fair-minded chroniclers of national security issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-presidency-is-beginning-to-unravel/2017/05/16/e27aa366-3a7a-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html|title=Trump's presidency is beginning to unravel |last=Ignatius |first=David |date=May 16, 2017 |work=The Washington Post|access-date=May 19, 2017|last2=Ignatius|first2=David|language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel W. Drezner]], professor of international politics at the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]], ''Lawfare'' is an example of "outside intellectuals" who "exercised real influence in the Trump era."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |author=Daniel W. Drezner |user=dandrezner |date=May 17, 2017 |title=At my UCLA talk I was asked if any outside intellectuals exercised real influence in the Trump Era. I answered 'Lawfare!' |number=865010791392595968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blog has been criticized by attorney and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]]. Writing in ''The New York Times'' he said the blog has a "courtier Beltway mentality" devoted to "serving, venerating and justifying the acts of those in power."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Donald Trump]], the 45th [[president of the United States]], has a history of speech and actions that have been widely viewed as [[racism|racist]] or racially charged.

So we'll leave it at that."&lt;ref name="bbcRape2019"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48687356|title=Trump stands by 1989 Central Park Five comments|date=June 19, 2019|url-status=live|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black professionals ===
In a 1989 interview with [[Bryant Gumbel]], Trump stated: "A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market." ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine reported that Trump's statement was not confirmed by studies of factual evidence concerning the impact of an applicant's race on their job prospects.&lt;ref name=fortune-20160607 /&gt;

In his 1991 book ''[[Trumped! (book)|Trumped!]]'' John O'Donnell quoted Trump as allegedly saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've got black accountants at [[Golden Nugget Atlantic City|Trump Castle]] and at [[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino|Trump Plaza]]. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing [[Kippah|yarmulkes]].... Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else... Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that's guy's lazy. And it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Trump told ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine in an interview published in 1997 "The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true". Two years later, when seeking the nomination of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] for president, Trump denied having made the statement.&lt;ref name="fortune-20160607"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://fortune.com/2016/06/07/donald-trump-racism-quotes/|title=Is Donald Trump Racist?

=== White supremacist David Duke ===

Trump has made comments on white supremacist [[David Duke]].&lt;ref name=WaPoDuke&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kessler |first1=Glenn |title=Donald Trump and David Duke: For the record |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/01/donald-trump-and-david-duke-for-the-record/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=July 31, 2019 |date=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PolitiFact]] noted that Duke was a topic in which Trump had changed his stance to offer false remarks.&lt;ref name=PFDuke&gt;{{cite web |last1=Qiu |first1=Linda |title=17 times Donald Trump said one thing and then denied it |url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/06/17-things-donald-trump-said-and-then-denied-saying/ |work=[[PolitiFact]] |accessdate=July 31, 2019 |date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, when Trump was asked about Duke receiving a majority of white votes in the [[1991 Louisiana gubernatorial election|Louisiana gubernatorial election]] (Duke however lost the overall vote), Trump reacted: "I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there’s a lot of hostility in this country ... People are angry about the jobs."&lt;ref name=WaPoDuke/&gt;

In 2000, Trump refused the Reform Party's nomination of him for President, because of other people who had joined the party. Trump pointed out "a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]]", "a [[Communism|communist]]", and in the case of Duke, "a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]]". Trump also called Duke "a bigot, a racist, a problem."&lt;ref name=WaPoDuke/&gt;

In 2015, as a presidential candidate, Trump was asked about Duke's "quasi-endorsement" of him, to which Trump replied: "I certainly wouldn't want his endorsement". During the same interview, Trump was asked if he would "repudiate" Duke, Trump said: "I would do that, if it made you feel better. I don't know anything about him."&lt;ref name=WaPoDuke/&gt;

On February 25, 2016, Duke said that he did "support" a vote for Trump. On February 26, Trump said that he "didn't even know" Duke endorsed him: "I disavow, okay?"&lt;ref name=WaPoDuke/&gt;

On February 28, Trump was asked by CNN's [[Jake Tapper]] if he would "unequivocally condemn" Duke and reject votes from him and other white supremacists. Trump responded: "I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists." Tapper asked again if Trump would condemn white supremacists and reject their support; Trump refused to do that immediately, saying: "I have to look at the group ... You wouldn’t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about ... I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong." Tapper then specifically asked Trump about the [[Ku Klux Klan]] twice, with Trump replying: "But you may have groups in there that are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So, give me a list of the groups, and I will let you know ... I don’t know any — honestly, I don’t know David Duke."&lt;ref name=WaPoDuke/&gt; PolitiFact gave Trump's February 28 claim that he knew nothing about Duke their worst rating, "Pants on Fire!" false, pointing to his statements two days earlier, and in previous years 1991, 2000 and 2015.&lt;ref name=PFDuke/&gt;

On February 29, 2016, Trump blamed his answers on Duke the previous day on "a very bad earpiece". He declared: "I don’t mind disavowing anybody and I disavowed David Duke ... I have no problem disavowing groups, but I’d at least like to know who they are. It would be very unfair to disavow a group if the group shouldn't be disavowed." On March 1, Trump was asked if he was prepared to clearly state that he was "renouncing the support of all white supremacists", to which Trump replied: "I am."&lt;ref name=WaPoDuke/&gt;

=== Native American casino industry ===
During the early 1990s, competition from an expanding [[Native American gaming|Native American casino industry]] threatened his Atlantic City investments. During this period Trump stated that "nobody likes Indians as much as Donald Trump" but then claimed without evidence that the mob had infiltrated Native American casinos, that there was no way "Indians" or an "Indian chief" could stand up to the mob, implied that the casinos were not in fact owned by Native Americans based on the owners' appearance, and depicted Native Americans as greedy.&lt;ref name=nativeamer&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boburg |first1=Shawn |title=Donald Trump's long history of clashes with Native Americans |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/donald-trumps-long-history-of-clashes-with-native-americans/2016/07/25/80ea91ca-3d77-11e6-80bc-d06711fd2125_story.html |accessdate=July 16, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=July 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chief |first1=David Lightman; Washington Bureau |title=Trump Criticizes Pequots, Casino |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1993-10-06-0000003863-story.html |accessdate=July 17, 2019 |work=Hartford Courant |date=October 6, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Trump and his associates were fined $250,000 and publicly apologized for failing to reveal that they had financed advertisements criticizing the proposal of building more Native American casinos in the [[Catskill Mountains]], which alluded to [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] Indians doing [[cocaine]] and bringing violence, asking: "Are these the new neighbors we want?" The advertisements, claiming to be funded by "grass-roots, pro-family" donors, were actually designed by [[Roger Stone]], while Trump approved and financed the million-dollar venture.&lt;ref name=nativeamer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bagli |first1=Charles |title=Trump and Others Accept Fines For Ads in Opposition to Casinos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/06/nyregion/trump-and-others-accept-fines-for-ads-in-opposition-to-casinos.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 22, 2019 |date=October 6, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Apprentice'' ===

In April 2005, Trump appeared on [[Howard Stern]]'s radio show, where Trump proposed that the [[The Apprentice (American season 4)|fourth season]] of the television show &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' would feature an exclusively white team of [[blonde]]s competing against a team of only African-Americans. Stern asked Trump if that would start a "racial war", to which Trump replied: "it would be handled very beautifully by me ... I'm very diplomatic." The proposal was rejected by television executives at [[NBC]]. The actual fourth season of ''The Apprentice'' concluded with Trump asking the male African-American winner of the season, Randal Pinkett, to share the honor with the runners-up, a white woman. Pinkett said this was "racist".&lt;ref name="apprentice4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/us/politics/trump-race-record.html|title=Trump Employs an Old Tactic: Using Race for Gain|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|date=July 20, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 22, 2019|url-status=live|last2=Grynbaum|first2=Michael|last3=Haberman|first3=Maggie|last4=Karni|first4=Annie|last5=Buettner|first5=Russ|author-link=Peter Baker (journalist)|author-link3=Maggie Haberman|author-link4=Annie Karni|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has also been accused of using racial slurs during filming of ''The Apprentice''. Former ''Apprentice'' contestant and former Trump administration communications director [[Omarosa Manigault Newman]] claims that Trump used "the N-word and others." Bill Pruitt, co-producer of Season One of ''The Apprentice'' has also claimed that Trump used a racial slur during filming of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/07/08/trump-racial-slur-rumors-resurface-new-book-method-madness/1677839001/|title=Donald Trump racial-slur allegations resurface in new book 'The Method to the Madness'|last=VanDenburgh|first=Barbara|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey Arabs===
At a rally in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on November 21, 2015, Trump falsely claimed that he had seen television reports about "thousands and thousands" of [[Arab Americans]] in [[New Jersey]] celebrating as the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] collapsed during the [[9/11 attacks]].

=== Somali refugees ===
In August 2016 Trump campaigned in [[Maine]], which has a large immigrant [[Somalis|Somali]] population. At a rally he said, "We've just seen many, many crimes getting worse all the time, and as Maine knows — a major destination for Somali refugees — right, am I right?" Trump also alluded to risks of terrorism, referring to an incident in June 2016 when three young Somali men were found guilty of planning to join the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="bostonglobe.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mainers defend Somali neighbors against Trump |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/08/05/maine-sees-somalian-community-starkly-different-than-what-donald-trump-portrayed/qOh4IjKY3VYYcxNG7zkcBM/story.html |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |first1=Brian |last1=MacQuarrie |first2=Vivian |last2=Wang |date=August 6, 2016 |access-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], home to the largest population of Maine Somalis, the police chief said Somalis have integrated into the city and they have not caused an increase in crime; crime is actually going down, not up. The mayor said Lewiston is safe and they all get along. At a Somali support rally following Trump's comments the Portland mayor welcomed the city's Somali residents, saying, "We need you here." Maine Republican senator [[Susan Collins]] commented, "Mr. Trump's statements disparaging immigrants who have come to this country legally are particularly unhelpful. Maine has benefited from people from Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and, increasingly, Africa — including our friends from Somalia."&lt;ref name="bostonglobe.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Story |last=Hinckley |title=In one town, how Mainers and new immigrants learned to coexist – until Trump |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2017/0306/In-one-town-how-Mainers-and-new-immigrants-learned-to-coexist-until-Trump |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=March 6, 2017 |access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial accusations on Twitter and in debates ===
Prior to and during the 2016 campaign, Trump used his political platform to spread disparaging messages against various racial groups.

You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse.

Other claims were directed towards President Barack Obama. Trump blamed Obama for the [[Ferguson unrest|2014 Ferguson unrest]] with "President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community" as well as the [[2015 Baltimore protests|2015 Baltimore riots]] in "Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!"&lt;ref name="Saletan"&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Saletan |title=No, Not Everything Is Racist |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/no-not-everything-is-racist-but-donald-trump-is.html |newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=January 12, 2018 |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump also made unsourced claims stating that Obama "wasn't a very good student" who needed some sort of ambiguous help to get into college,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nia-Malika |last=Henderson |title=Trump, in New Hampshire, takes credit for release of Obama birth certificate |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-meet-with-gop-officials-in-new-hampshire/2011/04/26/AF9V2awE_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 27, 2011 |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that Obama may not have attended courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Farley |title=Donald Trumps says people who went to school with Obama never saw him |url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-people-who-went-school-obama-nev/ |work=[[Politifact]] |date=February 14, 2011 |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; repeated on several occasions the conspiracy theory that Obama had [[Bill Ayers]] write his book for him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles M. |last=Blow |title=Trump, Grand Wizard of Birtherism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/opinion/trump-grand-wizard-of-birtherism.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 17, 2016 |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated, "Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Blow |last=Charles M. |title=Trump's Obama Obsession |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/opinion/trumps-obama-obsession.html |newspaper=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 29, 2017 |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump claimed that Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] used "the N-word" to describe Obama, stating that this showed that Putin has no respect for Obama and that Trump himself would do a better job in such a position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew|last=Buncombe |title=Donald Trump implies Vladimir Putin uses the 'N-word' to describe Barack Obama |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-russia-implies-vladimir-putin-uses-the-n-word-to-describe-barack-obama-a7158721.html |newspaper=[[The Independent|Independent]] |date=July 27, 2016 |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump also suggested that evangelicals should not trust [[Ted Cruz]] because Cruz is [[Cuban Americans|Cuban]] and that [[Jeb Bush]] "has to like the Mexican illegals because of his wife," who is [[Mexican Americans|Mexican American]].&lt;ref name="Saletan"/&gt;

=== Minority outreach during 2016 campaign ===

Trump's popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] was low according to polling data; a nationwide survey conducted in February 2016 showed that some 80 percent of Hispanic voters had an unfavorable view of Trump (including 70 percent who had a "very unfavorable" view), more than double the percentage of any other Republican candidate.&lt;ref name="BalzClement"&gt;Dan Balz and Scott Clement, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2016/02/25/poll-trumps-negatives-among-hispanics-rise-worst-in-gop-field/ Poll: Trump's negatives among Hispanics rise; worst in GOP field], ''The Washington Post'' (February 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; These low rankings are attributed to Trump campaigning in support of a proposed Mexican border wall and his rhetoric against illegal immigration.&lt;ref name="BalzClement" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Oliphant &amp; Luciana Lopez, [https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/in-florida-donald-trump-finds-some-support-among-hispanic-republicans/2269150/ Some Hispanic Republicans fear for party's future if Trump wins in Florida], Reuters (March 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preston"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Julia |last=Preston |title=More Latinos Seek Citizenship to Vote Against Trump |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/us/trumps-rise-spurs-latino-immigrants-to-naturalize-to-vote-against-him.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 8, 2016|date=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite expectations of low Latino support, Trump received about 29% of the Hispanic vote, slightly more than Romney received in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/11/09/hispanic-vote-election-2016-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/93540772/ |title=Another election surprise: Many Hispanics backed Trump |last=Gomez |first=Alan |work=USA Today |date=November 9, 2016 |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, at a rally in [[Redding, California]], Trump pointed to a man in the audience—Gregory Cheadle, a real estate broker—and said, "Look at my African American over here. Look at him. Are you the greatest?" Cheadle later declared in 2019 that he was so unhappy with Trump's "white superiority complex" and the "pro-white" Republican Party's usage of blacks as "political pawns" that he was leaving the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/man-trump-once-called-my-african-american-leaves-republican-party|title=Why the man Trump once called 'my African American' is leaving the GOP|date=2019-09-12|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2019-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to polling data during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump was receiving little support from [[African Americans]]. In a [[Morning Consult]] poll in August 2016, only 5% of black voters said they intend to vote for Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://morningconsult.com/2016/08/28/trump-gains-ground-clinton-black-voters-still-wary/ |title=Trump Gains Ground on Clinton; Black Voters Still Wary |last=Johnson |first=Fawn |date=August 28, 2016 |work=Morning Consult |accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Trump ended up receiving 8% of the African-American vote (about 500,000 more votes than [[Mitt Romney]] received in 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-so-many-blacks-backed_b_12913720 |title=Why So Many Blacks Backed Trump |last=Hutchinson |first=Earl |date=November 14, 2016 |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Virginia in August 2016, Trump said, "You're living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed – what the hell do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-courts-black-vote-while-avoiding-african-american-communities-1471944606 |title=Donald Trump Courts Black Vote While Avoiding African-American Communities |last=Epstein |first=Reid |date=August 24, 2016 |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trump_Immigration_Order_Sparks_Protests_at_NY_Airport.webmhd.webm|thumb|right|'Trump Immigration Order Sparks Protests at NY Airport' report from [[Voice of America]]]]
On January 27, 2017, via [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]], which he titled [[Executive Order 13769|Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States]], President Trump ordered the U.S border indefinitely closed to [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]] fleeing the [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]]. He also abruptly temporarily halted (for 90 days) immigration from six other Muslim-majority nations: Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Human rights activists described these actions as government-approved [[religious persecution]]. The order was stayed by Federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shear |first1=Micheal D. |last2=Cooper |first2=Helen |title=Trump Bars Refugees and Citizens of 7 Muslim Countries |work=The New York Times |date=January 27, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html| access-date =January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shear |first1=Micheal D.|last2=Kluish |first2=Nicholas |last3=Feuer |first3=Alan |title=Judge Blocks Trump Order on Refugees Amid Chaos and Outcry Worldwide |work=The New York Times |date=January 28, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html| access-date =January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump White House would go on to issue [[Executive Order 13780|revised versions of the ban]] on March 6, 2017 and September 24, 2017. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] eventually [[Trump v. Hawaii|upheld the third version]] in June 2018, with
Chief Justice Roberts writing for the majority that "The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44619976 |title=Travel ban: Trump hails 'tremendous' Supreme Court ruling|publisher=BBC |date=26 June 2020 |accessdate=30 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, dissenting, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] compared the opinion to one made in 1944 which allowed the [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=de Vogue |first1=Ariane |last2=Stracqualursi |first2=Veronica |title=Supreme Court upholds travel ban |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/travel-ban-supreme-court/index.html |accessdate=26 June 2018 |publisher=CNN |date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial writer [[Moustafa Bayoumi]] criticised the Supreme Court for upholding the Executive Order, commenting, "The Muslim ban ruling legitimates Trump's bigotry [...]

=== Black Caucus ===
In a February 2017 presidential press conference, White House press correspondent [[April Ryan]] asked Trump if he would involve the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] when making plans for executive orders affecting inner city areas. Trump replied, "Well, I would. I tell you what. Do you want to set up the meeting?" When Ryan said she was just a reporter, Trump pursued, "Are they friends of yours?" ''The New York Times'' wrote that Trump was "apparently oblivious to the racial undertones of posing such a query to a black journalist". Journalist [[Jonathan Capehart]] commented, "Does he think that all black people know each other and she's going to go run off and set up a meeting for him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grynbaum|first1=Michael|title=For April Ryan, Clashes With the White House Bring a New Kind of Prominence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/business/media/april-ryan-white-house-spicer-trump.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, six members of the Congressional Black Caucus met with President Trump to discuss the caucus's reply to Trump's campaign-rally question to African Americans, "What do you have to lose?" (by voting for him). The question was part of Trump's campaign rhetoric that was seen as characterizing all African Americans in terms of helpless poverty and inner-city violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donald Trump to African American and Hispanic voters: 'What do you have to lose?' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/22/donald-trump-to-african-american-and-hispanic-voters-what-do-you-have-to-lose/ |author=Johnson, Jenna |date=August 22, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to two people who attended the March meeting, Trump asked caucus members if they personally knew new cabinet member [[Ben Carson]] and appeared surprised when no one said they knew him. Also, when a caucus member told Trump that cuts to [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families|welfare programs]] would hurt her constituents, "not all of whom are black",&lt;ref name="newsweek 2018-01-20"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sit|first1=Ryan|title=Trump Thinks Only Black People Are on Welfare, But, Really, White Americans Receive Most Benefits |url=https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-welfare-black-white-780252 |work=Newsweek |accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the president replied, "Really? Then what are they?", although most welfare recipients are white.&lt;ref name="newsweek 2018-01-20" /&gt; The caucus chairman, Rep. [[Cedric Richmond]], later said the meeting was productive and that the goals of the caucus and the administration were more similar than different: "The route to get there is where you may see differences.

=== Derogatory statements towards Haiti and Nigeria ===
In June 2017, Trump called together a staff meeting to complain about the number of immigrants who had entered the country since his inauguration. ''The New York Times'' reported that two officials at the meeting state that when Trump read off a sheet stating that 15,000 persons had visited from [[Haiti]], he commented, "They all have [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]," and when reading that 40,000 persons had visited from [[Nigeria]], he said that after seeing America the Nigerians would never "go back to their huts." Both officials who heard Trump's statements relayed them to other staff members at the time, but the White House has denied that Trump used those words and some of the other officials present claim not to remember them being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=STOKING FEARS, TRUMP DEFIED BUREAUCRACY TO ADVANCE IMMIGRATION AGENDA |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html |author=Shear, Michael |date=December 23, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 after [[Hurricane Maria]] struck Puerto Rico and decimated services across the island, the Mayor of San Juan Carmen Yulín Cruz went on television to plea for help and accused the federal response of fatal inefficiency. Trump responded with a series of tweets claiming that the Puerto Rican leadership were "not able to get their workers to help" because "They want everything to be done for them" while claiming that federal workers were doing a "fantastic job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donald Trump: Puerto Rico Wants 'Everything to Be Done for Them' |url=https://time.com/4963903/donald-trump-puerto-rican-leaders-want-everything-to-be-done-for-them/ |last=Segarra |first=Lisa Marie |date=September 30, 2017 |work=Time|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the death toll on the island reached into the thousands, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York and others criticized the federal government and suggested that racism was partially to blame for the insufficient response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cuomo blames racism for weak federal response to Hurricane Maria victims |url=https://nypost.com/2018/06/10/cuomo-blames-racism-for-weak-federal-response-to-hurricane-maria-victims/ |author=Attanasio, Cedar |date=June 10, 2018 |publisher=New York Post|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NFL national anthem protests ===
{{See also|U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)}}
In August 2016 [[Colin Kaepernick]], an [[National Football League|NFL]] [[quarterback]], began sitting (later kneeling) during the playing of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|U.S. national anthem]] before games as a protest of police brutality and racial inequality suffered by Black Americans. Then-candidate Trump entered into the debate within days, stating of Kaepernick, "I think it’s personally not a good thing, I think it’s a terrible thing. And, you know, maybe he should find a country that works better for him. Let him try, it won’t happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilder|first1=Charlotte|title=Donald Trump says Colin Kaepernick should find a new country|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/08/donald-trump-colin-kaepernick-new-country-national-anthem-protest-response|newspaper=USAToday|date=August 30, 2016 |accessdate=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the start of the next [[2017 NFL season|NFL season]] in September 2017, President Trump commented extensively on the protests during a rally for Alabama Senate candidate [[Luther Strange]], stating, "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired.' You know, some owner is going to do that. He's going to say, 'That guy that disrespects our flag, he's fired.'

In a player-owner meeting several owners expressed reluctance to continue allowing players to protest as they feared Trump. [[New England Patriots]] owner [[Robert Kraft]], a public supporter of Trump, stated "The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don’t feel is in the best interests of America.

In his initial statement on the rally, Trump condemned "hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides" but did not directly denounce white nationalists. His statement and his subsequent defenses of it, in which he also referred to "very fine people on both sides", suggested a moral equivalence between the white supremacist marchers and those who protested against them, leading some observers to state that he was sympathetic to white supremacy.&lt;ref name="nyt-boost"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-charlottesville-white-nationalists.html |title=Trump Gives White Supremacists an Unequivocal Boost |work=[[The New York Times]] |first1=Glenn |last1=Thrush |first2=Maggie |last2=Haberman |author-link1=Glenn Thrush |author-link2=Maggie Haberman |date=August 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.is/dOezP |archive-date=August 16, 2017 |url-status=live |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump later said: "I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally".&lt;ref name=Blake-190426&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/25/meet-trump-charlottesville-truthers/ | title=Trump tries to re-write his own history on Charlottesville and 'both sides' | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=April 26, 2019 | accessdate=January 14, 2020 | first=Aaron | last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McAuliffe-190730&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newsweek.com/2019/08/09/charlottesville-donald-trump-speech-terry-mcauliffe-1451610.html | title=How Donald Trump Decided to go Soft on White Supremacists | work=[[Newsweek]] | date=July 30, 2019 | accessdate=January 14, 2020 | first=Terry | last=McAuliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five days after the rally, Trump returned to Twitter to express sympathy with the original rally and their defense of [[List of Confederate monuments and memorials|Confederate statues]], writing, "Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments" and "the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump mourns loss of 'beautiful statues and monuments' in wake of Charlottesville rally over Robert E.

Ten days after the rally, in prepared remarks at an [[American Legion]] conference, Trump called for the country to unite. He said: "We are not defined by the color of our skin, the figure on our paycheck or the party of our politics. Rather, we are defined by our shared humanity, our citizenship in this magnificent nation and by the love that fills our hearts." The remarks came a day after further racially divisive remarks he had made at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, where he had said of those who wish to take down Confederate statues, "They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fabian|first1=Jordan|title=After divisive rally, Trump calls for unity|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/347689-after-divisive-rally-trump-calls-for-unity|newspaper=The Hill |date=August 23, 2017 |accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump paints himself as the real victim of Charlottesville in angry speech|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/23/donald-trump-arizona-rally-phoenix|accessdate=February 23, 2018|work=The Guardian|date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tweet to mark the first anniversary, Trump stated "The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. We must come together as a nation. I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans!" Critics contended that the wording "all types of racism" could be seen as a veiled defense of white nationalists, similarly to his "both sides" remarks on the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump condemns 'all types of racism' on Charlottesville anniversary; critics slam wording|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/11/donald-trump-charlottesville-anniversary-condemn-all-racism/965715002/|accessdate=August 12, 2018|work=USA Today|date=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on during the questioning, Nielsen said, "I remember specific cuss words being used by a variety of members," without elaborating on what was said or by whom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cillizza|first1=Chris|title=Here's exactly how Dick Durbin destroyed Kirstjen Nielsen's 'shithole' explanation|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/16/politics/durbin-nielsen-analysis/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cory Booker blasts Republicans for amnesia over Trump's 'shithole' remark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/cory-booker-blasts-republicans-for-amnesia-over-trumps-shithole-remark |work=The Guardian |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=2019-03-11|date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Booker to Nielsen: Your Silence is Complicity|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJeYvCZUDu0|publisher=Associated Press Archive|via=YouTube|date=2018-01-21|accessdate=2019-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican senators [[Tom Cotton]] of Arkansas and [[David Perdue]] of Georgia, also present at the meeting, initially issued a joint statement stating that they "do not recall the President saying those comments specifically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/1/12/16885312/trump-shithole-countries-denial |title=2 Republican senators have come down with a case of "shithole"-related amnesia |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, both senators denied that Trump had said "shithole".

Conservative columnist [[Erick Erickson]] said Trump had privately bragged to friends about making the remarks, thinking "it would play well with the base."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savransky|first1=Rebecca|title=Conservative writer: Trump called friends to brag about 's---hole countries' remark|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/368967-conservative-writer-trump-called-friends-to-brag-about-s-hole|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' quoted Trump's aides as saying Trump had called friends to ask how his political supporters would react to the coverage of the incident, and that he was "not particularly upset" by its publication.&lt;ref name="Wash Post 2018-01-15"/&gt;

==== Response from Republicans ====
Vice President [[Mike Pence]] stated that he "knows the president's heart", and that Trump's goal is to reform the immigration system so that it is merit-based regardless of race, creed or country of origin, encouraging immigration by those who want to "contribute to a growing American economy and thriving communities."&lt;ref name=ap-20180122&gt;{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/7fa410a4b30b443bbddc8cee267fc3c0 |title=VP defends Trump over vulgar remarks on African immigrants |agency=[[Associated Press]] |first=Ken |last=Thomas |access-date=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time-01-22-18"&gt;{{cite news | title=Pence Defends Trump's 'Shithole Countries' Remark | work=Time | agency=Associated Press | date=January 22, 2018 | url=http://time.com/5112715/mike-pence-donald-trump-immigrants-israel/ | access-date=February 18, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125174545/http://time.com/5112715/mike-pence-donald-trump-immigrants-israel/ | archive-date=January 25, 2018 | url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Republican lawmakers denounced Trump's comments, calling them "unfortunate" and "indefensible", while others sidestepped or did not respond to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Thomas |last2=Baumbaertner |first2=Emily |last3=Parlapiano |first3=Alicia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/12/us/politics/republican-statements-trump-shithole.html |title=How Republican Lawmakers Responded to Trump's Vulgar Immigration Remarks |date=January 14, 2018 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; House speaker [[Paul Ryan]] said, "So, first thing that came to my mind was very unfortunate, unhelpful." Senator [[Susan Collins]] of Maine, who said she would not vote for Trump and has been very critical of him, said: "These comments are highly inappropriate and out of bounds and could hurt efforts for a bipartisan immigration agreement. The president should not denigrate other countries." Senator [[Tim Scott]] of South Carolina, the only African-American Republican in the Senate, and Senator [[James Lankford]] of Oklahoma, called the comments "disappointing".&lt;ref name="cnnreact" /&gt;

Representative [[Mia Love]] of Utah, who is of Haitian descent, tweeted that the comments were "unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nation's values". She later stated they were "really difficult to hear, especially because my [Haitian immigrant] parents were such big supporters of the president.... there are countries that struggle out there but ... their people are good people and they're part of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Haitian-American GOP congresswoman demands Trump apologize |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/mia-love-response-trump-shithole/index.html|author=Kenny, Caroline |date=January 12, 2018 |publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GOP Rep.

==== International response ====
[[File:Museveni_July_2012_Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|After the supposed "shithole countries" remark, Ugandan president [[Yoweri Museveni]] praised Trump saying "I love Trump because he talks to Africans frankly."]]
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the [[United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], said at a news briefing, "There is no other word one can use but racist. You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as 'shitholes', whose entire populations, who are not white, are therefore not welcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/12/unkind-divisive-elitist-international-outcry-over-trumps-shithole-countries-remark |title=UN condemns Donald Trump's 'shithole countries' remark as racist |first1=Patrick |last1=Wintour |first2=Jason |last2=Burke |first3=Anna |last3=Livsey |date=January 12, 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Union]] issued a statement strongly condemning the remarks and demanding a retraction and apology; an AU spokeswoman said, "Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, [Trump's statement] flies in the face of all accepted behavior and practice. This is particularly surprising as the United States of America remains a global example of how migration gave birth to a nation built on strong values of diversity and opportunity."&lt;ref name="Kranz"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kranz |first1=Michael |title='Irresponsible, reprehensible, and racist': Here's how the world reacted to Trump's 'shithole' comments |url=https://www.businessinsider.sg/reactions-around-the-world-to-trump-shithole-comments-2018-1/ |work=Business Insider |accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of International Affairs of [[Botswana]] summoned the US ambassador, and said in a statement "We view the utterances by the current American President as highly irresponsible, reprehensible, and racist."&lt;ref name="Kranz"/&gt; The [[African National Congress]], the ruling party in South Africa, tweeted "its offensive for President Trump to make derogatory statements about countries that do not share policy positions with the US.

Haiti's ambassador to the US said Haiti "vehemently condemn[ed]" Trump's comments, saying they were "based on stereotypes".

=== "The Snake" song and story  ===
Starting with his presidential run in 2016, Trump has often told the story of "The Snake," inspired by [[The Snake (song)|the song written by Oscar Brown Jr]]. In Trump's retelling, the story becomes an allegory used to warn of the danger posed by immigrants. In February 2018, Trump faced criticism after including the story during a speech to the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]]. Maggie Brown, daughter of Oscar Brown Jr., stated that Trump's immigration agenda "deals with separatism, racism, sexism, and it's kind of thing that's polar opposite to what Oscar Brown Jr was about." Conservative communications and public affairs strategist Steve Schmidt said "Trump’s snake story is vicious, disgraceful, utterly racist and profoundly un-American."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-the-snake-lyrics-immigration-policy-daughters-anger-us-president-a8230771.html|title=Daughter of man who wrote "The Snake" tells Trump: Stop using my father's poem to smear immigrants|date=2018-02-27|work=The Independent|access-date=2019-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian language researcher Kateryna Pilyarchuk claims that "Trump has used 'The Snake' to whip up racist fervor at raucous rallies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/insects-floods-and-the-snake-what-trumps-use-of-metaphors-reveals/|title=Insects, Floods and "The Snake": What Trump's Use of Metaphors Reveals|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|access-date=2019-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigrants in Europe ===
In July 2018, while on a trip to Europe, Trump said in an interview with [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] newspaper that "I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad, I think what has happened to Europe is a shame. I think it changed the fabric of Europe and, unless you act very quickly, it’s never going to be what it was and I don’t mean that in a positive way, I think you are losing your culture. Look around. You go through certain areas that didn’t exist ten or 15 years ago," On the same trip, during a joint press conference with Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], Trump again commented on immigration in Europe: "I think it's been very bad for Europe. I think Europe is a place I know very well and I think what has happened is very tough. It's a very tough situation, I just think it's changing the culture. It's a very negative thing for Europe." May responded by saying that "Over the years, overall immigration has been good for the UK. It brought people with different backgrounds and outlooks here to the UK and we've seen them contributing to our society and economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/immigration-changing-culture-europe-trump/story?id=56564695|title=Immigration is a 'very negative thing' for Europe: Trump|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2019-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White farmers in South Africa ===
In August 2018, Trump sent a tweet stating that he had ordered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to look into [[Land reform in South Africa|land seizures]] and [[South African farm attacks|the mass killing of white farmers]] in South Africa, acting on a [[White genocide conspiracy theory|racist conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's tweet echoing white nationalist propaganda about South African farmers, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/23/17772056/south-africa-trump-tweet-afriforum-white-farmers-violence |author=Williams, Jennifer |date=August 23, 2018 |publisher=Vox|access-date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump under fire for claim of 'large scale killing' of white farmers in South Africa |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-under-fire-claim-large-scale-killing-white-farmers-south-n903171 |author=Jamieson, Allistair |date=August 23, 2018 |publisher=[[NBC News]]|access-date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, farming organisation [[AgriSA]] had recently reported that the murder rate on farms had declined to the lowest level in twenty years,&lt;ref name="agriSA20Years"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/farm-murder-rate-lowest-in-20-years-remoteness-the-reason-for-brutality-20180531 |title=Farm murders lowest in 20 years, 'remoteness' the reason for brutality |first=Jan |last=Bornman |date=May 31, 2018 |work=News24 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one-third of the level recorded in 1998.&lt;ref name="southAfricanLowest20"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/farm-murders-at-their-lowest-in-20-years-report/ |title=Farm murders at their lowest rate in 20 years - report |first=Siviwe |last=Breakfast |date=May 31, 2018 |work=The South African |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] issued a statement:

=== "I am a nationalist" ===
At a rally in Houston in October 2018, Trump stated "You know, they have a word – it’s sort of became old-fashioned – it’s called a nationalist. And I say, really, we’re not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I’m a nationalist, okay? I’m a nationalist. Nationalist. Nothing wrong. Use that word. Use that word." Trump later denied that there was any racial connotation connected to his use of the word. Many others, however, suggested that his use of the word nationalist was dangerously close to the phrase white nationalist. Reformed neo-Nazi Christian Picciolini, for example, tweeted that "Trump's 'I'm a Nationalist' comment will likely represent the biggest boon for white supremacist recruitment since the film Birth of a Nation glorified the Klan in 1915 and gained the KKK 4 million members by 1925."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/24/trump-says-hes-nationalist-what-means-why-its-controversial/1748521002/|title='I am a nationalist': Trump's embrace of controversial label sparks uproar|last=Cummings|first=William|work=USA Today|access-date=2019-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Trump-backed ad removed ===
In November 2018, [[Facebook]], NBC, and [[Fox News]] withdrew a controversial political campaign ad which was backed by Trump after critics described it as racist. Shown prior to the midterm elections, the ad focused on a migrant caravan then traveling through Mexico with hopes of immigration to the U.S., and [[Luis Bracamontes]], an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing two sheriff's deputies in California in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fox News, NBC and Facebook Pull Trump-Backed Anti-Migrant Ad |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-05/nbc-pulls-trump-backed-anti-migrant-ad-after-prime-time-airing |agency=Bloomberg News |accessdate=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill ===

In May 2019, the Trump administration announced that the plan to replace the portrait of [[Andrew Jackson]] on the [[United States twenty-dollar bill|twenty-dollar bill]] with that of [[Harriet Tubman]] by 2020, as had been planned by the Obama administration, would be delayed until 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/trump-delays-putting-harriet-tubman-on-20-bill-outrage |title=Outrage as Trump delays putting Harriet Tubman on $20 bill until 2026 |publisher=The Guardian |date=23 May 2019 |accessdate=29 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics viewed this decision as a reflection of Trump's racism, including Representative [[Ayanna Pressley]], who said "Secretary Mnuchin has allowed Trump’s racism and misogyny to prevent him from carrying out the will of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/harriet-tubman-bill.html|title=See a Design of the Harriet Tubman $20 Bill That Mnuchin Delayed|last=Rappeport|first=Alan|date=2019-06-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-28|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump is a great admirer of Andrew Jackson and had his portrait installed in the Oval Office immediately after moving into the White House. Critics have suggested that Trump's support of Jackson is "barely veiled racism" as an attempt to appeal to his largely white political base. Critics of Trump's embrace of Jackson point to Jackson's ownership of slaves and genocide against Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Man Who Put Andrew Jackson in Trump’s Oval Office|url=http://politi.co/2mZOuHp|last=Glasser|first=Susan B.|website=POLITICO Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to their countries ===

On July 14, 2019, Trump tweeted about four Democratic congresswomen, and although he did not mention any member of Congress by name, it was widely inferred that he was referring to [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], [[Ayanna Pressley]], [[Ilhan Omar]], and [[Rashida Tlaib]].

The [[U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) specifically cites the phrase "[[Go back where you came from|Go back to where you came from]]" as the type of language that may violate [[Employment discrimination law in the United States|anti-discrimination employment laws]]. 
"Ethnic slurs and other verbal or physical conduct because of nationality are illegal if they are severe or pervasive and create an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment, interfere with work performance, or negatively affect job opportunities." The EEOC's website states: "Examples of potentially unlawful conduct include insults, taunting, or ethnic epithets, such as making fun of a person's foreign accent or comments like, 'Go back to where you came from,' whether made by supervisors or by co-workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Silverstein |first1=Jason |title=Federal agency: "Go back to where you came from" is discrimination |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eeoc-go-back-where-you-came-from-discrimination-federal-law-trump-tweets/ |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=July 18, 2019 |date=July 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Rat and rodent infested mess" ===

On July 27, 2019, Trump used Twitter to criticize Representative [[Elijah Cummings]], the [[Maryland's 7th congressional district|Maryland district he represents]], and the city of [[Baltimore]]. Cummings, who is black, was Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which was heading investigations of the Trump administration, including of [[Trump administration migrant detentions|its migrant detentions]]. The district Cummings represents is over 50% black according to the [[U.S. Census]]. It includes parts of Baltimore as well as suburban areas. Trump's tweets came less than an hour after a ''Fox &amp; Friends'' segment by Kimberly Klacik criticizing Cummings and his district.

Trump has a history of describing largely black populated areas as being "infested", including African nations in 2014, Atlanta in 2017, sanctuary cities in 2018, and the places he decided the "Squad" should "go back" to in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whenever Trump says 'infested', we know he's talking about people of colour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/30/trump-infested-baltimore-congresswomen |accessdate=August 3, 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=July 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trump Twitter Archive |url=http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive/infest/ttff |accessdate=August 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Representative [[John Lewis (civil rights leader)|John Lewis]] refused to attend Trump's inauguration in 2017, Trump said that Lewis "should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested)".&lt;ref name=Ming1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ming2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ming3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ming4/&gt;

Cummings responded that it was his "moral duty to fight for [his] constituents", pointing out that to do so, he had previously asked for Trump's support in passing laws to lower prescription drug prices, while linking to a 2017 article from Democratic representatives lamenting that Trump did not offer support on such issues. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who was born in Baltimore, and Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned his remarks as racist.&lt;ref name=Ming1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ming2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ming3/&gt;

Trump continued his attacks hours later: "Elijah Cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through "Oversight." He does NOTHING for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district!" Cummings' Maryland district's median income is above the average for American districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Segers |first1=Grace |title=Trump sparks outrage with derogatory tweets about Rep.

On July 27, the editorial board of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' responded to Trump's statements. They argued that Trump also has a responsibility to solve Baltimore's problems, since the White House has more power than any single congressman. They concluded: "Better to have some vermin living in your neighborhood than to be one."&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore Sun Editorial Board, ''[https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0728-trump-baltimore-20190727-k6ac4yvnpvcczlaexdfglifada-story.html Better to have a few rats than to be one]'', The Baltimore Sun, Saturday, July 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, Trump wrote "There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!". Trump's Acting chief of staff, [[Mick Mulvaney]], defended the comments in television interviews, saying that he understood why some people think Trump's comments are racist, "but that doesn’t mean that it is racist." Trump also called Cummings a "racist", without explanation, and retweeted a British right-wing commentator that labelled Baltimore as a "proper sh*thole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stepping up feud, Trump assails Cummings as 'racist' |url=https://apnews.com/76da6dbad40e4209827abacc0b3d3ea7 |accessdate=29 July 2019 |agency=Associated Press |date=29 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Allan |title=Trump calls Cummings a 'racist' in second day of attacks on lawmaker, Baltimore |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-continues-attacks-cummings-baltimore-n1035466 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019 |date=July 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tubman |first1=Kadia |title=Trump doubles down on Cummings attacks, shares vulgar comment about Baltimore on Twitter |url=https://news.yahoo.com/trump-doubles-down-on-cummings-attacks-shares-vulgar-comment-about-baltimore-on-twitter-205406597.html |work=[[Yahoo!

On July 29, [[Al Sharpton]], a black activist for civil rights, tweeted: "Arrived in DC from Atlanta, headed to Baltimore. Long day but can’t stop." Trump quoted and responded to that tweet of Sharpton's, declaring: "I have known Al for 25 years. Went to fights with him &amp; Don King, always got along well. He 'loved Trump!' He would ask me for favors often. Al is a con man, a troublemaker, always looking for a score. Just doing his thing. Must have intimidated Comcast/NBC. Hates Whites &amp; Cops!"

Regarding Trump's rhetoric, the [[Washington National Cathedral]] issued a statement from its leaders [[Mariann Budde]], [[Randolph Hollerith]] and Kelly Douglas. They condemned Trump's statements as "dangerous", because "violent words lead to violent actions". They asked when would Americans declare that they "have had enough" of Trump's words and actions, which both attract and shield "white supremacists who consider people of color a sub-human 'infestation' in America ...

Following the [[2019 El Paso shooting|mass shooting]] that took place in [[El Paso, Texas]] during the first week of August 2019, Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric was widely criticized, especially remarks regarding Hispanics and his repeated warnings about an immigrant "invasion", the same wording used by the El Paso shooter in his anti-immigrant manifesto in which he wrote, "this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas." Representative [[Veronica Escobar]], whose district includes a large part of the city, said "Words have consequences. The president has made my community and my people the enemy. He has told the country that we are people to be feared, people to be hated." Presidential candidate [[Beto O'Rourke]], who is from El Paso, stated: "Anyone who is surprised is part of this problem right now — including members of the media who ask, ‘Hey Beto, do you think the president is racist?' Well, Jesus Christ, of course he’s racist. He’s been racist from day one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Of Course He's Racist': 2020 Democrats Criticize Trump After Shootings |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/us/politics/beto-trump.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=August 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='We were safe until he started talking': El Paso residents respond to President Trump |url=https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-08-05/el-paso-shooting-residents-respond-to-president-trump |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As protests continued, Washington, D.C. mayor [[Muriel Bowser]] criticised Trump for stating that protesters who climbed over the White House fence would be met by "the most vicious dogs and ominous of weapons", saying it was "no subtle reminder to African-Americans of segregationists that let dogs out on women, children and innocent people in the South".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/30/nation/trump-encourages-supporters-rally-threatens-military-response-protests/ Trump encourages supporters to rally, threatens military response to protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing the names of military bases===
In June 2020, the [[United States Army|US Army]] proposed opening discussions surrounding the renaming of bases that have been named after [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] generals. Many people and organizations such as the NAACP have suggested renaming the bases after military heroes of color rather than white supremacist traitors. Trump responded with a tweet stating that "my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ismay|first=John|date=2020-06-10|title=The Army Was Open to Replacing Confederate Base Names.

=== Moving date of Tulsa rally ===
Trump had planned to hold his first rally since March on 19 June 2020 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but this provoked an outcry as it would have overlapped [[Juneteenth]] - a day commemorating the end of slavery. The rally also caused controversy due to the location's associations with the [[Tulsa race massacre|Tulsa massacre]], the worst case of [[Mass racial violence in the United States|racial violence]] in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Davidson|first=Paul|title='Black Wall Street': Trump's plan for rally in Tulsa calls attention to 1921 race massacre|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/15/trump-tulsa-rally-juneteenth-black-wall-street-massacre-greenwood/3179886001/|access-date=2020-06-15|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump initially defended the plans, stating that his rally would be a celebration, but then announced that the rally would be moved to 20 June "out of respect".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-moves-tulsa-rally-juneteenth-june-20-respect/story?id=71231688 |title=Trump moves his Tulsa rally from Juneteenth to June 20 'out of respect' |publisher=abcnews |date=13 June 2020 |accessdate=13 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Lincoln's end result "questionable" ===
In a June 12, 2020 interview with Fox News host [[Harris Faulkner]], a black woman, Trump claimed to have done more for blacks than the 16th president [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Trump further suggested that although Lincoln "did good", the end result was "always questionable" but when pressed admitted "So I’m going to take a pass on Abe." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-06-12|title=Watch: Trump's Harris Faulkner Exchange on Abraham Lincoln|url=https://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-awkwardly-tells-harris-faulkner-hes-done-more-for-african-americans-than-any-president-lincoln-did-good-although/|access-date=2020-06-13|website=Mediaite|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Nazi symbol in Facebook ads===
In June 2020, Facebook removed Trump campaign ads that included an upside down red triangle, a symbol which the Nazis had used to label opponents of their regime. The Trump campaign claimed that the symbol was used by Antifa, but experts contend that this is inaccurate and some critics viewed the symbol as a racist dog whistle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Morrison|first=Sara|date=2020-06-18|title=Facebook takes down another Trump campaign ad, this time for Nazi imagery|url=https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/18/21295226/facebook-trump-campaign-nazi-symbol-antifa|access-date=2020-06-22|website=Vox|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook stated that “We removed these posts and ads for violating our policy against organized hate.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Karni|first=Annie|date=2020-06-18|title=Facebook Removes Trump Ads Displaying Symbol Used by Nazis|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/facebook-trump-ads-antifa-red-triangle.html|access-date=2020-06-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Impact ==
Donald Trump has been accused of "inflaming racial, ethnic and religious tensions across the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five months of Trump: Muslims' fears were high but neighbors stood by them|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/20/trump-muslims-pennsylvania-the-promise|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] recorded 867 "hate incidents" in the 10 days after the US election, a phenomenon it partly blamed on Trump's rhetoric. They consider the actual number of incidents to be much higher because most [[hate crimes]] go unreported. SPLC president Richard Cohen blamed the recent surge on the divisive language used by Trump throughout his campaign. In a statement he said: "Mr Trump claims he's surprised his election has unleashed a barrage of hate across the country. But he shouldn't be. It's the predictable result of the campaign he waged."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sidahmed|first1=Mazin|title=Trump's election led to 'barrage of hate', report finds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/29/trump-related-hate-crimes-report-southern-poverty-law-center|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[US Attorney General|US attorney general]] [[Loretta Lynch]] said [[FBI]] statistics for 2015 showed a 67% increase in hate crimes against Muslim Americans; hate crimes against Jewish people, African Americans and LGBT individuals increased as well. Lynch reported a 6% overall increase, though she said the number could be higher because many incidents go unreported. In New York City the number of hate crimes increased 31.5% in the year from 2015 to 2016. Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] commented, "A lot of us are very concerned that a lot of divisive speech was used during the campaign by the President-elect, and we do not yet know what the impact of that will be on our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Make America White Again': Hate speech and crimes post-election|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/us/post-election-hate-crimes-and-fears-trnd/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2014 and 2018, the number of hate groups skyrocketed 30%, reaching 892 in 2015; 917 in 2016; 954 in 2017; and to a record number 1,020 in 2018.&lt;ref name="splc2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/year-hate-and-extremism|title=The Year in Hate and Extremism|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/hate-groups-grow-straight-year-splc-180221192119355.html|title=Hate groups in US grow for third straight year: SPLC|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark Potok at the SPLC, [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]] speeches "demonizing statements about Latinos and Muslims have electrified the radical right, leading to glowing endorsements from white nationalist leaders such as [[Jared Taylor]] and former Klansman [[David Duke]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anonymous-shut-down-kkk-website_n_5720c204e4b0b49df6a9b333|title=How Anonymous Is Fighting White Supremacy Online|first=Casey|last= Williams|work=The Huffington Post|date=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux Klan]] held a rally at the Charlottesville [[Unite the Right rally]] in 2017. Former grand wizard David Duke spoke calling the demonstrations a "turning point" saying, "We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in. That’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nelson |first1=Libby |title="Why we voted for Donald Trump": David Duke explains the white supremacist Charlottesville protests |url=https://www.vox.com/2017/8/12/16138358/charlottesville-protests-david-duke-kkk |work=Vox |accessdate=August 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study found that Trump's anti-establishment campaign positions, for example his frequent "drain the swamp" rhetoric, was less of a draw for voters than were his negative attitudes towards ethnic minorities and sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Explaining the Trump Vote: The Effect of Racist Resentment and Anti-Immigrant Sentiments |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/537A8ABA46783791BFF4E2E36B90C0BE/S1049096518000367a.pdf/explaining_the_trump_vote_the_effect_of_racist_resentment_and_antiimmigrant_sentiments.pdf |website=Politics (study) |accessdate=October 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that "Trump’s rhetoric and rallies served to heighten white identity and increase the perceived threat facing white

In 2019, the [[Brookings Institution]] reported that statistics show that Trump's racist rhetoric has resulted in an increase in violence in America. Their study found "substantial evidence that Trump has encouraged racism and benefitted politically from it." Looking at hate crime figures in which Trump had won the election they found a jump of hate crimes, the second largest jump in 25 years, the first being [[September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trump and racism: What do the data say? |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/08/14/trump-and-racism-what-do-the-data-say/ |publisher=Brookings Institution |accessdate=October 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on students ===
A survey of over 10,000 teachers conducted by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]'s Teaching Tolerance project after the 2016 presidential election showed that "the results of the election are having a profoundly negative impact on schools and students." Most respondents believe the impact will be long-lasting. Respondents reported an increase in "verbal harassment, the use of slurs and derogatory language, and disturbing incidents involving swastikas, Nazi salutes and Confederate flags". "Nearly a third of the incidents were motivated by anti-immigrant sentiment and anti-black incidents were the second-most common, with frequent references to lynching. Antisemitic and anti-Muslim attacks were common as well. SPLC believes "the dynamics and incidents these educators reported are nothing short of a crisis and should be treated as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Trump Effect: The Impact of The 2016 Presidential Election on Our Nation's Schools|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20161128/trump-effect-impact-2016-presidential-election-our-nations-schools#about%20the%20survey|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pri.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Southern Poverty president Richard Cohen commented, "We've seen Donald Trump behave like a 12 year old, and now we're seeing 12 year olds behave like Donald Trump."&lt;ref name="pri.org"&gt;{{cite news|title=What's the 'Trump Effect' in schools?

A 2020 survey of news stories since Trump's election found 300 reports that involved incidents of student bullying that were related to Trump's remarks or his MAGA campaign chants. At least three-quarters of the attacks were directed at black, Hispanic or Muslim students, but the report also found 45 cases of students being attacked because they were Trump supporters. 
The survey found that parents, players, or fans had used Trump's name or his words at least 48 times directed at students competing in elementary, middle and high school sporting events. Since most incidents are never reported it is believed that the figures they found are only a fraction of the actual total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trump's words, bullied kids, scarred schools |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/local/school-bullying-trump-words/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=May 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on children ===

Sociologist Margaret Hagerman studies and writes about young people's views on racism and current events in America. In her latest work, published in 2018, she reports on her conversations with young people as related to the election of Trump as president. She writes:

:"Every child of color I interviewed not only articulated disgust and outrage with the president’s racist language and actions but also described feeling scared, angry, anxious, upset, and worried because of Trump’s presidency and specifically what his racist actions might mean for themselves or the people they love."

Comparing the children of color to white children she writes:

:"For some of the white children I spoke with, this reality [of racism] seems to be connected to empathy, anger, and a sense of concern for their peers. But, for other white children, this reality simply does not matter, even though they know and can acknowledge that it exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Those Who Care and Those Who Don't: Children and Racism in the Trump Era |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/care-dont-children-racism-trump-era/ |work=[[Los Angeles Review of Books]] |accessdate=August 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions by the Congressional Black Caucus ===
Members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] (CBC) have criticized Trump for "repeatedly stirring racial controversies."&lt;ref name=hill-20180201 /&gt; [[Emanuel Cleaver]], former head of the CBC, voiced concerns when Trump began raising doubts about President Obama's birthplace: "I don't know if the people around the country understand that he has launched ... an assault against African-American people starting with his refusal to accept the first African-American president, by continuing to declare that he was from Kenya. No other president in history has had to face that kind of criticism. We've come to conclude that this is a part of his belief system."&lt;ref name=hill-20180201&gt;{{cite news |title=Black Dems take lead in push to impeach Trump |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/371743-black-dems-take-lead-in-push-to-impeach-trump |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |first1=Cristina |last1=Marcos |first2=Mike |last2=Lillis |date=February 1, 2018 |access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some lawmakers protested by refusing to attend Trump's [[2018 State of the Union Address]]. [[John Lewis (civil rights leader)|John Lewis]] said "I've got to be moved by my conscience," and [[Barbara Lee]] said "This president does not respect the office, he dishonors it."

Almost two-thirds of the CBC have backed [[efforts to impeach Donald Trump]] in House floor votes forced by Representative [[Al Green (politician)|Al Green]]. Green's articles of impeachment assert that Trump has "brought the high office of president of the United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace and disrepute" and "has sown discord among the people of the United States".&lt;ref name=hill-20180201 /&gt;

Though perceived as anti-immigrant, Trump is himself the son of immigrants and has twice married wives who were immigrants.

Following White House protests over the death of [[George Floyd]], Trump tweeted, "The professionally managed so-called 'protesters' at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just there to cause trouble. The [[U.S. Secret Service]] handled them easily. Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???". Speaking to reporters on June 1, Trump was questioned as to whether he wanted to see his "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) supporters confront the Americans protesting for racial justice. Trump clarified his message saying:

== Analysis ==

=== Journalists and pundits ===
CNN White House correspondent [[Jim Acosta]] said the ''Washington Post'' report combined with statements made in 2016 and 2017 shows "the president seems to harbor racist feelings about people of color from other parts of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Acosta: Trump seems to harbor racist feelings |publisher=CNN |date=January 11, 2018 |url=https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/01/11/acosta-trump-slur-analysis-tsr.cnn/video/playlists/situation-room-highlights/ |access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Samuels |first=Brett |title=CNN's Acosta: Trump 'seems to harbor racist feelings' |newspaper=The Hill |date=January 11, 2018 |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/368602-cnns-acosta-trump-seems-to-harbor-racist-feelings |access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the incident in which Trump referred to several nations as "shithole countries", some media commentators moved from describing certain words and actions of Trump as manifesting racism, to calling Trump racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bauder |first=David |url=https://www.apnews.com/4cfbf11db6274a21b4f3a76f6c2ed03f |title=Some media figures call Trump racist after profane remarks |agency=Associated Press |date=January 13, 2018 |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]], speaking on ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'', called the president's statements "pretty clearly racist" and said, "It fits into a pattern that we have seen since the beginning of his career, maybe through his father's career, frankly. There's been a consistency, pattern of harsh judgment against black and brown people."&lt;ref name=pbs-shields-brooks /&gt; Trump has been called a racist by a number of ''New York Times'' columnists including [[Nicholas Kristof]] ("I don't see what else we can call him but a racist"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kristof|first1=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Kristof |title=Mr. Trump, Meet a Hero Whom You Maligned|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/opinion/sunday/trump-shithole-countries-emmanuel-mensah.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 22, 2018|date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles M.

Conservative pundit and former [[Republican National Committee]] chairman [[Michael Steele]], when asked in an interview in January 2018 if he thought Trump was a racist replied, "Yeah, I do. At this point the evidence is incontrovertible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/368702-ex-rnc-chair-says-trump-is-racist-the-evidence-is-incontrovertible |title=Ex-RNC chair says Trump is racist: 'The evidence is incontrovertible' |first=Brandon |last=Carter |date=January 12, 2018 |newspaper=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on [[MSNBC]], Steele said, "There are a whole lot of folks like Donald Trump. White folks in this country who have a problem with the browning of America. When they talk about [wanting] their country back, they are talking about a country that was very safely white, less brown and less committed to that browning process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herrerla|first1=Carla|title=Few Republicans Acknowledged Trump's 'Shithole' Slur|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-trump-shithole_us_5a5815b4e4b02cebbfda6179|publisher=HuffPost|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian political commentator and former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal party]] leader [[John Hewson]] writes in January 2018 that he believes the recent global movements against traditional politics and politicians are based on racism and prejudice. He comments: "There should be little doubt about US President Donald Trump's views on race, despite his occasional 'denials', assertions of 'fake news', and/or his semantic distinctions. His election campaign theme was effectively a promise to 'Make America Great Again; America First and Only' and – nod, nod, wink, wink – to Make America White Again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hewson|first1=John|title=No place for the race card in the political pack, but Trump plays it anyway|url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/no-place-for-the-race-card-in-the-political-pack--but-donald-trump-plays-it-anyway-20180118-h0k5wv.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2019, five ''New York Times'' writers stated that Trump has "decades" of history where he exploited "America's racial, ethnic and religious divisions" for personal gains of "ratings, fame, money or power", while ignoring negative consequences.&lt;ref name=apprentice4/&gt;

=== Academics ===
[[Doug McAdam]] writes that Trump "is just giving unusually loud and frank voice to views already typical among large numbers of Republicans" and "has pushed the GOP toward ever further racist and nativist extremes." McAdam believes that the Republican Party shift away from more liberal views on matters of racial equality began with [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidency in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Sense of the Rise and Impact of Donald Trump|url=https://scholars.org/contribution/making-sense-rise-and-impact-donald-trump|publisher=[[Scholars Strategy Network]]|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidential historian [[Douglas Brinkley]] said "What Trump is doing has popped up periodically, but in modern times, no president has been so racially insensitive and shown outright disdain for people who aren't white."&lt;ref name=ap-20180113&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's own words revive debate over whether he's racist |url=https://www.apnews.com/bce2dc7a054e4541bc77e2971c1bde4e/Trump%2527s-own-words-revive-debate-over-whether-he%2527s-racist |agency=[[Associated Press]] |first=Julie |last=Pace |date=January 13, 2018 |access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Yancy]], a professor at [[Emory University]] known for his work on racial issues, concluded that Trump is racist, describing his outlook as "a case of unabashed white supremacist ideas."&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/us/politics/trump-racism.html|title=A President Who Fans, Rather Than Douses, the Nation's Racial Fires|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=January 12, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 12, 2018|url-status=live|author-link=Peter Baker (journalist)|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking shortly after Trump's election, [[John Mcwhorter]] discussed the fact that 8% of black voters and around 25% of Latinos voted for Donald Trump, saying "many would see it as 'conservative' for a person of color to vote for a racist, as if it were still a time when racism was socially acceptable." In his view, people of color who voted for Trump were willing to look beyond Trump's racism to the promise of economic improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mcwhorter|first1=John|title=Race in Trump's America|url=https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/43/race-in-trumps-america/|work=[[Democracy (journal)|Democracy]]|accessdate=January 29, 2018|date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David P. Bryden, a professor of law emeritus at the [[University of Minnesota]], suggested that Trump was willing to "vilif[y] all those of any race whom he regards as obstacles to his ambitions." According to Bryden, Trump's targets are largely from minority groups because he wants to appeal to white working class voters who believe that progressives resent them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bryden |first=David P. |url=http://www.startribune.com/counterpoint-trump-a-racist-not-a-helpful-argument/444544843/ |title=Counterpoint: Trump a racist?

Pulido et al. published a study in 2018 comparing racism and environmental deregulation during the first year of Trump's presidency. The authors described that "transgressive" racism, or "spectacular" racism, is a "hallmark" of Trump's presidential campaign and presidency, with Trump employing it for "numerous political objectives, including dehumanizing his targets, consolidating his power, eroding democratic norms, and distracting from policy and legal changes". The result of Trump's racism is that "U.S. racial formation" has changed. "Overt white supremacy" has emerged in racial culture. The authors document that in the first year of Trump's presidency, there were 83 racial actions and 173 environmental actions; meanwhile there were 271 instances of racial speech and 22 instances of environmental speech. The authors concluded that "actions were more likely to be environmentally related, whereas rhetoric was more likely to be racist", further positing that "spectacular racism has helped obscure the relatively smooth and devastating deregulation." However, the authors also cautioned that the numbers of actions taken "do not indicate impact", specifically pointing to the Muslim ban and restriction of asylum claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pulido|first1=Laura|first2=Tianna|last2=Bruno|first3=Cristina|last3=Faiver-Serna|first4=Cassandra|last4=Galentine|date=2018|title=Environmental Deregulation, Spectacular Racism, and White Nationalism in the Trump Era|journal=Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics|volume=109|issue=2|pages=520–532|doi=10.1080/24694452.2018.1549473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion polling ==
According to an August 2016 Suffolk University poll, 7% of those planning to vote for Trump thought he was racist. A November 2016 ''Post''-ABC poll found that 50% of Americans thought Trump was biased against black people; the figure was 75% among black Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/11/06/most-americans-think-trump-is-biased-against-women-or-black-people/ |title=Analysis - Most Americans think Trump is biased against women or black people |first=Philip |last=Bump |date=November 6, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an October 2017 Politico/Morning Consult poll, 45% of voters thought Trump was a racist, a plurality.&lt;ref name=politico-20171025&gt;{{cite news |title=Poll: Voters see Trump as reckless, not honest |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/25/trump-poll-reckless-honest-244126 |work=[[Politico]] |first=Steven |last=Shepard |date=October 25, 2017 |access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Quinnipiac poll]] asking the question, "Since the election of Donald Trump, do you believe the level of hatred and prejudice in the U.S. has increased, the level of hatred and prejudice has decreased, or hasn't it changed either way" was conducted in December 2017. Of the respondents, 62% believed that the level had increased, 4% felt that it had decreased, and 31% felt it was without change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quinnipiac Poll |url=https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2507 |publisher=Quinnipiac University Poll |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Quinnipiac poll conducted in January 2018 after Trump's Oval Office comments about immigration showed that 58 percent of American voters found the comments to be racist, while 59 percent said that he does not respect people of color as much as he respects white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/01/17/most-americans-saw-trumps-shithole-comments-as-racist/ | title=Most Americans considered Trump's 'shithole' comments racist | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 17, 2018 | last=Bump | first=Philip | accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quinnipiac Poll |url=https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2513 |publisher=Quinnipiac University Poll |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of pre- and post-election surveys from the [[American National Election Studies]], as well as numerous other surveys and studies, show that since the rise of Trump in the Republican Party, attitudes towards racism have become a more significant factor than economic issues in determining voters' party allegiance.&lt;ref name="nation-20170508"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/economic-anxiety-didnt-make-people-vote-trump-racism-did/|title=Economic Anxiety Didn't Make People Vote Trump, Racism Did|last1=McElwee|first1=Sean|date=May 8, 2017|work=[[The Nation]]|access-date=January 13, 2018|url-status=live|last2=McDaniel|first2=Jason|author-link=Sean McElwee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vox-20171215"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/15/16781222/trump-racism-economic-anxiety-study|title=The past year of research has made it very clear: Trump won because of racial resentment|last=Lopez|first=German|date=December 15, 2017|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=January 14, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a July 2019 Politico/Morning Consult poll, 54% of American voters viewed Trump as racist and 38% did not.&lt;ref name=politico-20190205&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shepard |first1=Steven |title=Poll: Majority of voters say 'send her back' chants were racist |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/24/send-her-back-chants-racist-poll-1428357 |accessdate=July 30, 2019 |work=POLITICO |date=July 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Quinnipiac University poll]] released in July found that 51% of voters believed that Trump is a racist while 45% said that he is not a racist.

'''Trump Heights''' ({{lang-he|רמת טראמפ}}, ''Ramat Trump'', {{IPA-he|ʁaˈmat ˈtʁamp|}}) is a planned [[Israeli settlement]] in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-occupied]] [[Golan Heights]] named after and in honor of the 45th President of the United States, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Sign-for-Trump-Heights-goes-up-on-Golan-592725|title=Trump thanks Netanyahu as sign for 'Trump Heights' goes up on Golan - Israel News - Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48656431|title=Israel unveils 'Trump Heights' in Golan|date=16 June 2019|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/16/18681116/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-town-golan-heights-trump-heights|title=Benjamin Netanyahu just unveiled Israel's newest town: "Trump Heights"|first=Zeeshan|last=Aleem|date=16 June 2019|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/israel-names-golan-heights-settlement-trump-1444237|title=Israel officially renames Golan Heights settlement after President Donald Trump|first=Jason Lemon On 6/16/19 at 4:02 PM|last=EDT|date=16 June 2019|website=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights are widely regarded as [[International law and Israeli settlements|illegal under international law]], but the Israeli government disputes this.&lt;ref name="BBC_The_Geneva_Convention"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be under the jurisdiction of [[Golan Regional Council]].

==Location==
The settlement is expected to be built east of the community of [[Kela Alon]], where the [[Beruchim]] community, which was founded in 1991, was located. The area of the settlement of Beruchim was planned for future expansion of the settlement of Kela Alon, and is inhabited by a few residents.

The settlement is very close to the [[Petroleum Road]]. This route separates Beruchim / Ramat Trump from East, and Kela Alon to the west of it.

== History ==
In 1991 an Israeli settlement called [[Brukhim]] was established on the land of the future Trump Heights. However, it failed to attract many residents.&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Trump Heights, Binyamin Netanyahu's tribute to America's president|url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/06/22/trump-heights-binyamin-netanyahus-tribute-to-americas-president|work=[[The Economist]]|date=22 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[government of Israel]] convened on June 16, 2019, at the planned location in the abandoned settlement of Brukhim, very close to [[Kela Alon]] in the north-west of the Golan Heights, and declared the establishment of the new settlement as [[gratitude]] to Donald Trump for support for Israel and [[United States recognition of the Golan Heights as part of Israel|recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights]].

"In appreciation of the work of the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump, on behalf of the State of Israel in a wide range of fields and out of gratitude for the American recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the recognition of Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, It was decided to initiate the establishment of a new community settlement in the Golan Heights called ''Trump Heights''." &lt;ref&gt;Eric Bander, [https://m.maariv.co.il/news/politics/Article-703519 "רמת טראמפ": היישוב החדש על שם נשיא ארה"ב ברמת הגולן], on [[Maariv]] website (In Hebrew), 13 June 2019 &lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, 110 housing units are planned.

On August 6, 2019, the National Planning and Building Council approved the establishment of the new settlement. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001296253]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the first community in Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]] named after a sitting American president since [[Kfar Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=USAmbIsrael |number=1140284207673090048 |date = 16 June 2019 |title=A great day on the Golan.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|June 2020}}, the site remained deserted and all but two letters of the entrance sign had been stolen by vandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Ilan Ben Zion | newspaper = The Forward | title = One year later, is the Golan’s desolate ‘Trump Heights’ a ‘hoax’? | date = 16 June 2020 | url = https://forward.com/news/israel/448892/one-year-later-is-the-golans-desolate-trump-heights-a-hoax/?utm_source=PostUp&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Afternoon%20Newsletter%20(Sunday%20RSS)&amp;utm_maildate=06/16/2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Trump appointees, including [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Michael Flynn]], [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Reince Priebus]], [[White House Communications Director]] [[Anthony Scaramucci]], and [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Tom Price (American politician)|Tom Price]] have the shortest-service tenures in the history of their respective offices.{{efn|Excluding interim appointments.}}

On September 18, 2019, a reporter asked Trump about the lack of stability in his administration, particularly in DHS. He replied: "We have acting people. The reason they are acting is because I'm seeing how I like them, and I'm liking a lot of them very, very much. There are people who have done a bad job, and I let them go. If you call that turmoil, I don't call that turmoil. I say that is being smart. That's what we do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-visit-border-wall-san-diego-ca/|title=Remarks by President Trump During Visit to the Border Wall|date=September 18, 2019|access-date=November 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107140554/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-visit-border-wall-san-diego-ca/|archive-date=November 7, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For comprehensiveness, the list below includes, in addition to dismissals and resignations, routine job changes such as promotions (e.g. Gina Haspel from CIA Deputy Director to Director), officials moving to a comparable position (e.g. John F. Kelly from Secretary of Homeland Security to Chief of Staff), and acting or temporary officials being replaced by permanent ones. The list does not include many lower level positions, however, such as that of executive director of the [[United States Interagency Council on Homelessness]], Matthew Doherty, dismissed in November 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stein |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Stein (author) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/16/trump-administration-ousts-top-homelessness-official-white-house-prepares-broad-crackdown/ |title=Trump administration ousts top homelessness official as White House prepares broad crackdown |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=November 16, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229004258/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/16/trump-administration-ousts-top-homelessness-official-white-house-prepares-broad-crackdown/?wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;wpmm=1 |archivedate=December 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; without a replacement to lead the council that was created in 1987. But some less prominent officials are listed because their departure was newsworthy.

As of May 25, 2020, there have been 415 unique names dismissed and/or resigned.

In the [[United States]], '''Obama-Trump voters''' (also known as '''Trump Democrats''' or Obama Republicans) voted for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] or [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] presidential elections (or both), but later voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee [[Donald Trump]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. These voters comprise 13% of Trump voters and 9% of Obama voters.&lt;ref name=bump&gt;Philip Bump, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/12/4-4-million-2012-obama-voters-stayed-home-in-2016-more-than-a-third-of-them-black/ 4.4 million 2012 Obama voters stayed home in 2016 — more than a third of them black]", ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 12, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, 7% of Obama voters did not vote and 3% voted for a third party candidate.&lt;ref name=bump /&gt; While some analysts consider them to have been decisive in Trump's victory, others have disputed this conclusion. Compared to other voters, Obama-Trump voters tend to have liberal economic views and conservative social views. They expressed skepticism of congressional Republicans and a desire to change the [[status quo]].

==Studies==

A study by the [[Democracy Fund]] Voter Study Group found that 9.2% of Obama voters voted for Trump in 2016.&lt;ref name=cohn/&gt; According to the [[American National Election Study]], 13% of Trump voters had voted for Obama in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvjke5/regretful-trump-voters-i-dont-understand-how-it-could-be-worse |title=Regretful Trump Voters: 'I Don't Understand How It Could Be Worse' |last=Dent |first=David |date=2017-09-20 |website=Vice |language=en-us |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have argued that these voters had a disproportionately large impact on the 2016 election because they were concentrated in key [[swing state]]s in the [[United States Midwest|Midwest]], while others have said they were actually "Obama Republicans" rather than Democrats to begin with.&lt;ref name=cohn&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/upshot/the-obama-trump-voters-are-real-heres-what-they-think.html |title=The Obama-Trump Voters Are Real.

==Significance==

[[Dana Milbank]] has disputed both the quantity and the significance of Obama-Trump voters in deciding the outcome of the 2016 election. Milbank argued in an August 2017 ''[[Washington Post]]'' column that the number of such voters was initially overstated, and that most of them were Republicans who only defected from their party to vote for Obama, not Democrats who defected to support Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/may-not-be-as-many-trump-democrats-as-previously-imagined.html |title=There May Not Be As Many 'Trump Democrats' As Previously Imagined |last=Kilgore |first=Ed |date=2017-08-04 |website=Daily Intelligencer |language=en |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nate Cohn]] responded to Milbank's criticism by arguing that Milbank's focus on national data obscured the magnitude of Democratic defection to support Trump. Cohn noted that when looking specifically at white Obama voters with no higher education than a [[high school diploma]], Clinton won only 74% (based on data from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group) or 78% (based on the [[Cooperative Congressional Election Study]] (CCES)).&lt;ref name=cohn/&gt;

==Voters' views==

Shortly before the 2016 election, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Obama voters who now planned to vote for Trump felt he was now the embodiment of the "change" they had hoped for when they voted for Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/us/politics/obama-donald-trump-voting.html |title=Some Who Saw Change in Obama Find It Now in Donald Trump |last=Alcindor |first=Yamiche |date=2016-11-02 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-02-25 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple [[focus group]]s of Obama-Trump voters convened by the [[Roosevelt Institute]] and [[Democracy Corps]] in early 2017 showed that, in general, these voters wanted to change the [[status quo]], and had skeptical views of Congressional Republicans and their proposals. The same focus groups also indicated that these voters hoped President Trump would help reduce health care costs for working-class Americans, and that they were anxious about some immigrant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rooseveltinstitute.org/obama-trump-voters-expect-change-dont-trust-gop/ |title=Focus Group: Obama-to-Trump Voters Expect Change, Don't Trust GOP to Deliver |date=2017-03-15 |website=Roosevelt Institute |language=en-US |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group found that Obama-Trump voters generally had liberal views on economic issues, but conservative views on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2017/6/16/15817702/democrats-economics-trump-obama-voters |title=Democrats are unlikely to win back Obama-Trump voters.

==Support for President Trump==

A September 2017 poll found that 70% of Obama-Trump voters approved of the job Trump was doing as president. This figure was significantly lower than the 88% approval rating among all Trump voters. Similarly, the percent of voters who disapprove of Trump's performance in this poll was much higher among Obama-Trump voters (22%) than among Trump voters as a whole (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/06/trump-obama-voters-poll-242334 |title=Poll: Obama-Trump voters drifting away from the president |date=2017-09-06 |website=POLITICO |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="133895" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|President Trump's policies for physical infrastructure}}
{{Donald Trump series}}The '''infrastructure policy of Donald Trump''' includes ensuring U.S. energy independence (by catering to the fossil fuel, nuclear, and renewable energy industry), safeguarding the cybersecurity of the national power grid and other critical infrastructure, locking China out of the U.S. fifth-generation Internet market, and rolling back regulations to ease the process of planning and construction. While there have been no major infrastructure spending packages yet, some individual policies and projects have advanced piecemeal, especially in rural areas.

Although there is recognition of the need to upgrade American infrastructure from both sides of the political aisle, as of April 2020, no major infrastructure bill has been passed due to disagreements over the details of such a spending package, namely, what to spend on, how much to spend, and how to pay for it. 'Infrastructure' is a rather broad term that means different things to different people. In general, the aim of the Trump administration is revitalizing the national economy and enhancing national security despite the tendency of his own Republican Party to oppose large federal expenditures and tax hikes whereas members of the opposition Democratic Party typically favor investing in renewable energy and new infrastructure that could combat climate change, and tend to be less averse to deficit spending.

This article focuses exclusively on physical or [[hard infrastructure]], as opposed to [[soft infrastructure]], or public institutions.

== Views, vision, and standards ==
Infrastructure development is a priority of the Donald Trump administration. He considers the modernization of American [[infrastructure]] as an extension of his career as a real estate developer and a concrete item to add to his legacy as President.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/17/trump-tax-hike-rumors-infrastructure-1331703|title=Trump aides try to quash tax hike rumors amid infrastructure talks|date=May 17, 2019|work=Politico|access-date=June 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also views infrastructure investments as a tool to create jobs and to spur economic growth.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Edwards|first=Hayley Sweetlands|url=https://time.com/4247162/donald-trump-trains-infrastructure/|title=Trump Agrees With Democrats on High-Speed Trains|date=March 4, 2016|work=Time|access-date=September 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 2015 book ''Crippled America'', he cites the Senate Budget Committee estimate that "rebuilding America will create 13 million jobs."&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; As early as May 2015, one month before launching his presidential campaign, Donald Trump expressed his desire to "fix" America's aging infrastructure,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; making it "second to none."&lt;ref name="CSM-infra" /&gt; He expressed concern about the state of American infrastructure on multiple occasions, drawing comparisons with other countries. For example, he stated that American passenger trains were slow compared to those in China and American airports to be dirty and dilapidated next to their counterparts from China, Saudi Arabia, or Qatar.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Laing|first=Keith|url=https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/255554-trump-takes-shot-at-laguardia-airport|title=Trump takes a shot at NYC's LaGuardia Airport|date=September 30, 2015|work=The Hill|access-date=September 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that modernizing American infrastructure was going to be expensive but argued that in the end, such an investment would pay for itself. In this regard, his position is in line with that of the Democratic Party. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had themselves been advocating for more federal infrastructure spending.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Extensive infrastructure spending is a key part of Trump's nationalist and populist economic platform, which also includes opposition to free trade, support for tariffs, and the repatriation of American jobs. This is unusual in the modern Republican Party, which typically endorses free-market or [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=Great Britain|pages=|chapter=Chapter 2: Promises}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientists [[Roger Eatwell]] and [[Matthew Goodwin]], while working-class voters have been leaving the Democratic Party since the 1960s, the popularity of Trump's economic platform suggests there have been sizeable pockets of voters mainstream Republicans failed to reach. However, according to economist [[Robert Reich]], the fact that Trump appears more interested in marketing his brand name rather than pursuing public policy hampers his chances of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=Great Britain|pages=|chapter=Chapter 10: Towards Post-populism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2019, Trump issued an executive order encouraging the purchase of U.S.-made construction materials for public infrastructure projects, especially those that need funding from the federal government.&lt;ref name="DJT-eo"&gt;Donald J. Trump. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-strengthening-buy-american-preferences-infrastructure-projects/ Executive Order on Strengthening Buy-American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects]. Issued January 31, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; This followed his 2017 "Buy American, Hire American" executive order restricting the hiring of foreign workers and tightening standards for federal acquisitions. As of February 2019, Canadian officials were negotiating an exemption for their country.&lt;ref name="FP-BAHA"&gt;[https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-signs-new-executive-order-to-strengthen-buy-america-initiative Trump orders agencies to buy U.S.-made steel, aluminum and cement 'to the greatest extent' possible]. ''Financial Post''. February 7, 2019. Accessed February 11, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental reviews of infrastructure projects ==
In April 2019, President Trump signed two executive orders intended to accelerate energy infrastructure projects. The first makes it harder for oil pipelines and other energy projects to be delayed due to environmental concerns.

In early January 2020, the Trump administration announced revisions of the 50-year-old [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) that would relax environmental regulations on infrastructure constructions in order to speed them up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=January 9, 2020|title=Trump proposes easing up regulations for major infrastructure projects|work=CBS News|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-proposes-easing-of-environmental-rules-to-speed-up-infrastructure-work-today-2020-01-09-live-stream/|url-status=live|access-date=January 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal agencies would no longer have to take climate change into account when assessing major infrastructure projects and would have to complete their comprehensive environmental reviews in two years. Infrastructure projects that require federal permits but little federal funding are exempt from such reviews. Nor would new projects have to account for "cumulative" effects. In the twenty-first century, this means investigating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and sea level rise, among other things. In addition, instead of applying for permits from each relevant government agency, only one decision from the government would be necessary. Signed into law in 1970 by President Richard Nixon, NEPA requires the federal government to analyze the environmental impacts of a given infrastructure project in detail. Due to its wide scope, both supporters and opponents believe this is one of the most litigated laws in the United States.&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Friedman|first=Lisa|date=January 3, 2020|title=Trump Rule Would Exclude Climate Change in Infrastructure Planning|work=The New York Times|department=Climate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/climate/trump-nepa-climate-change.html|url-status=live|access-date=January 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Brangham|first=William|last2=Harder|first2=Amy|date=January 9, 2020|title=Trump seeks to relax environmental regulation of some infrastructure projects|work=PBS Newshour|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-seeks-to-relax-environmental-regulation-of-some-infrastructure-projects|url-status=live|access-date=January 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Allassan|first=Fadel|date=January 9, 2020|title=Trump announces rule changes to exempt big projects from environmental review|work=Axios|url=https://www.axios.com/trump-environmental-review-rule-change-09ff8602-4ba2-4fc1-854a-cefa87375637.html|url-status=live|access-date=January 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEPA was drafted in response to a [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill|1969 oil spill off Santa Barbara]], California, that sparked public outcry, and other instances of air, land, and water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Knickmeyer|first=Ellen|date=January 9, 2020|title=WATCH: Trump unveils proposal that could speed up pipeline projects|work=PBS Newshour|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-trump-to-unveil-proposal-that-could-speed-up-pipeline-projects|url-status=live|access-date=January 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2020, there was only one major change. In 1983, it was decided that the use of worse-case scenarios should be limited.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;

On the fiftieth anniversary of NEPA, President Trump wrote, "The environmental review process designed to improve decision-making has become increasingly complex and difficult to navigate" because of the "significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects, and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members." Trump asserted that the revisions would "benefit our economy and environment." In fact, construction workers' unions have long argued that NEPA has been a burden on energy and public transportation projects.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt; Although the opponents of these proposed revisions were worried that they would make it easier for the oil and gas industry to build new pipelines, the Trump administration focused on schools and highways, which were probably of greater interest to the American people.&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; If the proposed revisions survived their legal challenges, environmental activists would no longer be able to halt pipeline construction by litigation, a key tool they have been using since the middle of the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; While there have been examples of bureaucracy being burdensome on building projects in the past, such a drastic change would likely invite even more lawsuits.&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt;

After 60 days of public hearing, a final regulation can be expected, probably before the 2020 Presidential election.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt;

== Background: State of American infrastructure (2015–2019) ==

Businesses and communities are concerned over the state of American infrastructure and the inability of Congress to fund a comprehensive modernization program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While federal, state, and local governments have been spending more on infrastructure repairs and maintenance in nominal terms, their actual purchasing power has been reduced because of the rising costs of construction materials. For that reason, amounts spent have fallen in real terms, despite a bump thanks to the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) following the Great Recession of 2007-8. Repairs and maintenance expenditures steadily climb while less money goes to capital projects.

Trump presented an infrastructure plan to Congress in February 2018, with $200 billion in federal funding and $1.5 trillion from the private sector.

===2020===
While Republicans have generally been skeptical of Democrats' proposals to finance massive infrastructure programs by debt, in late March 2020, as lawmakers ponder how to alleviate the severe economic downturn induced by the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]], they seem to have coalesced around the need to upgrade American infrastructure and create jobs. President Trump publicly endorsed this possible deal as the next phase of the federal response to the pandemic. Secretary of the Treasury [[Steven Mnuchin]] told CNBC the President would like to take advantage of low interest rates to finance this potential bill. The Democrats' infrastructure plan includes funds for passenger rail transportation – with money for Amtrak's stations and services –, ports and harbors, climate-change resiliency, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and expanding access to broadband Internet. A different plan passed the [[United States Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation Safety, Infrastructure Security, and Water Quality|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]] unanimously in July 2019; it would allocate $287 billion over five years, $259 billion of which to maintain and repair roads and bridges. President Trump mentioned this second plan in his [[2020 State of the Union Address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Emily|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/infrastructure-week-coronavirus.html|title=‘Infrastructure Week’ Returns as Trump and Democrats Eye Post-Virus Jobs Plan|date=April 1, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 8, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trump indicated he would like to go further than this Senate plan. In late March, he voiced his support for a potential "Phase 4" stimulus package worth two trillion dollars of infrastructure spending. He called it "Phase 4" because there were previously three stimulus bills aimed at mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Earlier in the year, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin discussed a possible infrastructure plans with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Richard Neal|Richard E. Neal]], but their talks were derailed as the pandemic continued to spread across the United States. In order for such a spending package to be passed, lawmakers from across the political spectrum would need to be able to overcome long-standing disputes over what to spend on, how much money to spend, and where the money comes from, because the term 'infrastructure' is quite broad and means different things specifically to different people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stein|first=Jeff|last2=Kim|first2=Seung Min|date=March 31, 2020|title=Trump pushes $2 trillion infrastructure package in next coronavirus bill, saying it must be ‘VERY BIG &amp; BOLD’|work=The Washington Post|department=Business|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/31/trump-democrats-coronavirus-infrastructure/|url-status=live|access-date=May 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Kentucky) and House Minority Leader Keven McCarthy (California) both expressed skepticism of the need for a fourth stimulus package in a row, saying that would like to wait and see the effects of the first three packages first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Singman|first=Brooke|date=March 31, 2020|title=Trump calls for $2T infrastructure bill as 'Phase 4' of coronavirus response|work=Fox News|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-for-2t-infrastructure-bill-as-phase-4-of-coronavirus-response|url-status=live|access-date=May 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act of 2019 includes $3 billion for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] to repair damages inflicted by natural disasters in the previous three years and to invest in resiliency and flood protection, unlocks $8.9 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and offers an additional $900 million to help the territory recover from [[Hurricane Maria]]. This bill also provides additional resources to the U.S. Forest Service for wildfire suppression activities. Some $1.6 billion is allocated to repairing roads and bridges post-disaster through the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Fund.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.constructiondive.com/news/trump-signs-19b-disaster-aid-bill-including-billions-for-infrastructure/556510/|title=Trump signs $19B disaster aid bill, including billions for infrastructure, resiliency|last=Slowey|first=Kim|date=June 10, 2019|work=Construction Dive|access-date=July 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also provides financial assistance to the U.S. Marine Corps base [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]] in North Carolina, which sustained $3 billion worth of damages by [[Hurricane Florence]].&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;

=== Electrical power grid ===
In late June 2017, about a week after cybersecurity experts realized that a piece of malware used to attack Ukraine's power grid the previous year could, with modifications, be used against the United States, President Trump met with cabinet officials, leaders from the energy sector, cybersecurity experts to discuss the threat. The federal government identifies energy infrastructure, mostly owned and operated by the private sector, as critical, and the Department of Homeland Security cooperates with the private sector to ensure its security. Using an executive order issued in May 2017, President Trump ordered, among other things, an investigation on America's preparedness against a cyber attack resulting in prolonged power outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Chalfant|first=Morgan|url=https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/338790-trump-holds-meeting-to-address-power-grid-cyber-threats|title=Trump holds meeting to address power grid cyber threats|date=June 21, 2017|work=The Hill|access-date=April 8, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], utility companies found themselves with considerable amounts of extra money in 2018. This means they could spend it on infrastructure upgrades and retraining displaced workers (from coal and nuclear power plants) without having to pass the cost onto consumers or requesting financial assistance from the government. According to the International Energy Agency, the United States needs to spend $2.1 trillion between 2014 and 2035 so that its grid can smoothly accommodate wind and solar power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dixon|first=Darius|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/06/trump-taxes-infrastructure-energy-395932|title=How Trump has already scored a win on infrastructure|date=February 6, 2018|work=Politico|access-date=April 8, 2020|url-status=live|department=Infrastructure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2020, the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) published a paper on the threats posed by [[Geomagnetic storm|geomagnetic storms]] to the nation's power grid. This research follows from President Trump's Executive Order 13865 on Coordinating National Resilience to Electromagnetic Pulses from March 2019. Such storms are caused by the interaction between solar winds and the Earth's magnetic field. Resultant magnetic perturbations generate electric fields,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Electromagnetic induction|Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction]].&lt;/ref&gt; which could disrupt ground-based electrical power grids. While geomagnetic storms do not occur that often, when sufficiently strong they can cause considerable damage. For example, the magnetic storm of 1921 set the telegraphic stations used by rail companies in New York ablaze. Those comparable to the [[Solar storm of 1859|Solar Storm of 1859]] pose an even greater threat. A study from the National Academy of Sciences suggests that if one were to occur in the twenty-first century, its economic damage could be as high as two trillion dollars. Due to the electrical properties of the rocks, the most vulnerable areas are in the Northern Midwestern and Northeastern United States, especially the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] formation, located east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], near some of the largest of American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Koontz|first=Heidi|url=https://phys.org/news/2020-04-geoelectric-hazard-potential-vulnerability-high-voltage.html|title=New geoelectric hazard map shows potential vulnerability to high-voltage power grid for two-thirds of the U.S.|date=April 8, 2020|work=Phys.org|access-date=April 8, 2020|url-status=live|department=Earth Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2020, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at protecting the U.S. national power grid against foreign cyber attacks. "A successful attack on our bulk-power system would present significant risks to our economy, human health and safety, and would render the United States less capable of acting in defense of itself and its allies," he wrote.&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Maggie|date=May 1, 2020|title=Trump issues executive order to protect power grid from attack|work=The Hill|url=https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/495711-trump-issues-executive-order-to-protect-us-power-grid-from-attack|url-status=live|access-date=May 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This executive order bans the purchase and installation of equipment manufactured outside the United States.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cimpanu|first=Catalin|date=May 1, 2020|title=Trump bans acquisition of foreign power grid equipment, citing hacking threats|work=ZDNet|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/trump-bans-acquisition-of-foreign-power-grid-equipment-citing-hacking-threats/|url-status=live|access-date=May 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it tasks the Secretary of Energy, [[Dan Brouillette]] at the time of its issuing, with creating a list of safe vendors, identifying any vulnerable components of the grid and replacing them. In 2018, then Secretary of Energy Rick Perry created the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) to combat cybersecurity threats to the U.S. power supply.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; While the U.S. has not witnessed any destructive cyber attacks on its power grid yet, foreign actors have conducted reconnaissance operations on this infrastructure. In January 2020, the FBI notified grid operators about the vulnerabilities in their software supply chain.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

=== Energy independence ===
President Donald Trump's position with regards to energy independence is similar to that of his predecessors dating back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/29/watch-president-trump-gives-a-speech-on-us-energy-dominance.html|title=Trump announces efforts to revive nuclear energy, export more American coal|last=DiChristopher|first=Tom|date=June 29, 2017|work=CNBC|access-date=June 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, argued that "An energy dominant America means self-reliant. It means a secure nation, free from the geopolitical turmoil of other nations who seek to use energy as an economic weapon."&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; In 1960, the world's leading oil exporters – Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela – joined forces to create the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ([[OPEC]]) in order control global oil prices, though they failed to achieve this objective until 1973. In October 1973, a brief but bloody and inconclusive war broke out between Israel and the Arab states. The Soviet Union and the United States helped secure a truce, but in an attempt to force the West to pressure Israel to withdraw from the territories it held since the [[Six-Day War|Six Days War]] of 1967, the Arab nations stopped selling oil to Western Europe, the United States, and Japan, causing a severe worldwide energy shortage. Previously, from the mid-nineteenth century up until right after World War II, the United States produced far more oil than it consumed. However, after the War, the number of American car owners ballooned, while oil was used to manufacture plastics, pesticides, fertilizers, among many other products. Oil and natural gas became quite popular for residential heating. At the eve of the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Arab-Israeli War]], the United States was importing one third of the oil it consumed. Although the Arab world lifted their oil embargo on the industrialized world after Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] managed to persuade Israel to withdraw from some of the territories it seized in the 1967 war, they announced that the price of oil was going up to $11.65 a barrel. It was $3.00 on the eve of the 1973 war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Nation: A History of the United States|last=Garraty|first=John A.|publisher=Harper Collins Publisher|year=1991|isbn=0-06-042312-9|edition=7th|location=|pages=873–74|chapter=Chapter XXXI The Best of Times, The Worst of Times - The Oil Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Jimmy Carter]] introduced a plan to conserve energy and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, which included a tax on gasoline, and on the "gas guzzlers," or cars that were particularly energy-inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Nation: A History of the United States|last=Garraty|first=John A.|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1991|isbn=0-06-042312-9|edition=7th|location=|pages=919|chapter=Chapter XXXIII Our Times - A Time of Troubles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation, coupled with increased production from countries outside of OPEC, such as Mexico, Norway, and the United Kingdom, helped gradually reduce the price of oil in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Nation - A History of the United States|last=Garraty|first=John A.|publisher=Harper Collins Publisher|year=1991|isbn=0-06-042312-9|edition=7th|location=|pages=926|chapter=Chapter XXXIII Our Times - Reagan as President}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. oil production has been steadily rising since 2009 while natural gas production increased 50% between 2005 and 2015, and then by 11% by 2018. Affordable and widely available energy resources have benefited manufacturers and consumers alike.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750528826/energy-boom-that-trump-celebrates-began-years-before-he-took-office|title=Energy Boom That Trump Celebrates Began Years Before He Took Office|last=Horsley|first=Scott|date=August 13, 2019|work=NPR|access-date=October 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, President Barack Obama, Trump's immediate predecessor, lifted a 40-year old ban on oil exports and granted over two dozen liquefied-natural-gas-export licenses.&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/28/trump-america-energy-dominant-policy.html|title=Trump wants America to be 'energy dominant.'

Shortly after taking office in 2017, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the [[Paris Agreement|2015 Paris Climate Agreement]], thereby fulfilling a campaign promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000|title=Trump's campaign promises - has he delivered on them?|last=|first=|date=December 24, 2018|work=BBC|access-date=June 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he wanted a "fair" deal that would not undermine U.S. workers and businesses,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48454674|title=US energy department rebrands gas exports 'molecules of freedom'|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2019|work=BBC|access-date=June 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; or compromise U.S. national sovereignty.&lt;ref name="NYTParis" /&gt; Proponents of the agreement argue, however, that backing out will result in a loss for the U.S. national economy as new [[green job]]s are offered instead to competitors overseas.&lt;ref name="NYTParis"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html|title=Trump Will Withdraw U.S. From Paris Climate Agreement|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=2017-06-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Trump replaced contents related to climate change from the Obama administration on the White House website with his official energy policy.

=== Fossil fuels ===
In January 2017, President Trump signed an executive order reviving the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]], bringing oil from shale reserves in North Dakota to refineries in Illinois along a route 1,172 miles (1,887&amp;nbsp;km) long. He insisted that American-made construction materials be used to create high-skilled jobs. [[TC Energy|TransCanada]], which owns the project, originally planned to use 65% of materials from the U.S. and the rest from Canada. This decision received support from the oil industry, which considered it long overdue. Opponents include Native American tribes who argued it could jeopardize their water supply, cause flooding, and disturb religiously important sites. Although President Obama rejected it, polls conducted jointly by ''The Washington Post'' and ABC News found that a clear majority of Americans, 55%, approved the project, expecting it to create plenty of jobs, while only 34% disapproved. However, they were divided on the question of environmental risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/24/trump-gives-green-light-to-dakota-access-keystone-xl-oil-pipelines/|title=Trump seeks to revive Dakota Access, Keystone XL oil pipelines|last=Mufson|first=Steven|date=January 24, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=October 1, 2019|last2=Eilperin|first2=Juliet|department=Climate and Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pipeline was completed by April 2017, and made its first oil delivery the following month.

In March 2017, the Trump administration approved the construction of the [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL Pipeline]], reversing a decision by the Obama administration and fulfilling a campaign promise.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This pipeline would bring 830,000 barrels of oil, equivalent to 35 million gallons or 132,490 cubic meters, from the [[Oil sands|tar sands]] of Alberta, Canada, across the U.S. states of Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska, before connecting to existing pipelines carrying crude oil to U.S. refineries. (See map on the right.)&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/court-lifts-block-on-keystone-xl-pipeline-construction/2019/06/07/43a63b74-8947-11e9-9d73-e2ba6bbf1b9b_story.html|title=Court lifts injunction blocking Keystone XL oil pipeline|last=Volz|first=Matt|date=June 7, 2019|work=Associated Press (via The Washington Post)|access-date=June 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project sparked intense opposition from environmental activists who argue that extracting oil from the oil sands produces 19% more greenhouse gases than traditional methods of crude oil extraction. The pipeline would also run across the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], one of the world's largest underground deposits of fresh water. According to a 2015 State Department report, this project would create 42,000 jobs directly and indirectly, including 3,900 construction jobs if the pipeline was built in a year, and 50 permanent jobs to maintain the pipeline.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/politics/keystone-xl-pipeline-trump-approve/index.html|title=Trump administration approves Keystone XL pipeline|last=|first=|date=March 23, 2017|work=CNN|access-date=June 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has been held up the courts. A U.S. District Court for Montana judge blocked the project in November 2018, arguing that the State Department failed to assess the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on Native American land resources. In March 2019, the President signed a new permit in order to circumvent the Montana court decision.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-transcanada-trump/trump-tries-fresh-approach-with-long-delayed-keystone-xl-pipeline-idUSKCN1RA2DG|title=Trump tries fresh approach with long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline|last=|first=|date=March 29, 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=June 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2019, a three-judge panel from the U.S. 9th District Court of Appeals lifted the injunction that blocked the pipeline's construction and dismissed a lawsuit by environmental and Native American groups. The appellate judges also agreed with the Justice Department that Trump's new permit nullified the legal challenge on environmental grounds.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; But this second permit was legally challenged by Native American groups as of October 2019.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;

In January 2018, the Interior Department announced plans to allow drilling in nearly all U.S. waters. This would be the largest expansion of offshore oil and gas leasing ever proposed, and includes regions that were long off-limits to development and more than 100 million acres in the [[Arctic]] and the [[Eastern Seaboard of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], regions that President Obama had placed under a drilling [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]].&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-opens-vast-waters-to-offshore-drilling/|title=Areas in the Pacific Ocean, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic Ocean, and much of the Eastern Seaboard are included in the new plan|website=Scientific American|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2019, the Department of Energy rebranded natural gas as "molecules of freedom" which it sought to export worldwide. The announcement was made during the expansion of a facility in Quintana Island, Texas, that produces liquefied natural gas. This expansion is expected to bring 3,000 jobs to the area.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In general, there is no difference between the export policy of the Trump administration for liquefied natural gas and that of the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;

At an event in Salt Lake City, Utah, Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced that the Trump administration is committed to making fossil fuels cleaner rather than imposing "draconian" regulations on them. He said the administration wanted to invest in the research of development of ways to reduce emissions as demand for coal drops and that for natural gas rises.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Perry pointed to efforts already underway to replace old and inefficient coal power plants and to use more liquefied natural gas.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-rick-perry-fossil-fuels-protest-20190530-story.html|title=Trump administration doubles down on fossil fuels|last=McCombs|first=Brady|date=May 30, 2019|work=Associated Press (via LA Times)|access-date=June 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. emissions fell by 13% between 2005 and 2017.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/491888c04e3244d4a4e473e7978f47cc|title=Energy secretary: US aims to making fossil fuels cleaner|last=McCombs|first=Brady|date=May 30, 2019|work=Associated Press|access-date=June 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Donald Trump rally in Huntington (a) (cropped) .png|thumb|Donald Trump at a rally in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], Pennsylvania, in 2017.]]
In June 2019, the Trump administration introduced a new rule on coal power plants' emissions, requiring electric utilities to cut their emissions to 35% below 2005 levels by 2030. It authorizes the setting up of targets for improving efficiency by state regulators and does not require switching from coal to other energy sources. This new rule replaces the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which established specific carbon-emissions reduction target for each state. However, according to the International Energy Agency, the [[Electricity sector of the United States|U.S. electricity sector]] would need to reduce its emissions by 74% below 2005 levels over the same period in order to prevent the global average temperature from rising by more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C. Nevertheless, utilities are already moving away from coal as the costs of alternatives become increasingly competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/trump-epa-finalizes-rollback-of-key-obama-climate-rule-that-targeted-coal-plants/2019/06/19/b8ff1702-8eeb-11e9-8f69-a2795fca3343_story.html|title=Trump EPA finalizes rollback of key Obama climate rule that targeted coal plants|last=Eilperin|first=Juliet|date=June 19, 2019|work=The Washington Post|access-date=July 15, 2019|last2=Dennis|first2=Brady}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil and gas industry has been growing rapidly, thanks to Trump's support for drilling both offshore and on public lands, as well as advances in [[hydraulic fracturing]], or fracking, technology.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/01/20/686531523/progress-report-president-trumps-campaign-promises-2-years-later|title=Progress Report: President Trump's Campaign Promises, 2 Years Later|last=Horsley|first=Scott|date=January 20, 2019|website=NPR|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of extraction involves pumping a mixture of water, sand, and some chemicals into the Earth to separate oil from rocks, and "[[Directional drilling|horizontal drilling]]," meaning digging a hole through layers of shale rocks, then changing direction at 90°. Fracking technology has been around for years, but recently, companies have been able to improve its speed and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/08/591141384/americas-oil-boom-is-fueled-by-a-tech-boom|title=America's Oil Boom Is Fueled By A Tech Boom|last=Buchele|first=Mose|date=March 8, 2018|work=NPR|access-date=June 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic consumption of natural gas jumped 10% in 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the past, the U.S. was the world's largest oil importer and prohibited oil exports; in 2018, it became one of the leading suppliers of light crude oil to Europe, behind only Russia and Iraq. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Italy are the top customers, importing almost seven eighths of U.S. exports to Europe. The U.S. could potentially replace Russia, the Middle East, and Africa as Asia's top supplier as well.

The Trump administration is selling leases in Alaska's [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] to oil companies for drilling. Although environmentalists oppose the project, saying that it damages the landscape and harms the caribou and birds that migrate there, some native Alaskans living in the area support the move. While infrastructure there is rather limited, residents receive their paychecks from the oil industry drilling in Prudhoe Bay, which also pays for a full-time fire department and a basketball gym. They also have [[flush toilet]]s, which do not exist in villages outside the Refuge. However, after a lease sale, an oil company will need to first drill some test wells to see if there is a significant amount of oil in the area, and if they find it, they need environmental reviews and permits before they can extract it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=738586917|title=Locals Support Trump's Decision To Allow Drilling In Alaska's Arctic Refuge|last=|first=|date=July 3, 2019|work=NPR|access-date=July 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheap and abundant energy has fueled the revival of American manufacturing. However, steel tariffs from the [[China–United States trade war]] also increased the cost of pipeline construction and other equipment.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;

=== Nuclear energy ===
[[File:US Nuclear Power Plant Status 9-2013.PNG|thumb|Status of U.S. nuclear power plants as of 2018 (EIA).]]
In 2017, President Trump announced his administration was launching a "complete review" of ways to revive and expand the [[Nuclear power in the United States|nuclear power industry]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Energy Secretary Rick Perry also noted the importance increasing the use of nuclear energy,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; calling it "a very important part" of the Trump administration's all-of-the-above energy strategy.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/nuclear-energy-is-on-the-front-burner-says-sec-rick-perry.html|title=Nuclear power on the 'front burner,' says Energy Secretary Rick Perry|last=DiChristopher|first=Tom|date=June 19, 2017|work=CNBC|access-date=June 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, nuclear reactors generate about one fifth of U.S. electricity, but this market share could fall to 11% by 2050 as the nation's aging nuclear power plants retire&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and because of competition from natural gas and renewable sources.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The potential loss of such a large chunk of the nation's zero-emissions electricity generation is a cause for concern, especially as the financial viability of large-scale nuclear power projects has come into question. Perry said his Department was looking into small [[Small modular reactor|modular nuclear reactors]], which can be put together to produce up to a quarter of the power a typical nuclear reactor generates.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As of 2019, there were about two dozens potentially viable modular reactor designs trying to enter the market. The U.S. also looks to export next-generation reactor technology overseas and compete with China and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=DiChristoper|first=Tom|date=March 21, 2019|title=The US is losing the nuclear energy export race to China and Russia.

Inconsistent government support and unfavorable bureaucracy and logistics have made research and development in civilian nuclear power difficult.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As of 2019, the average age of U.S. nuclear power stations is 39 years old.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-transitioning-to-only-renewable-energy-will-be-difficult-for-the-u-s|title=Why transitioning to only renewable energy will be difficult for the U.S.|last=Brangham|first=William|date=September 20, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=October 13, 2019|last2=O'Brien|first2=Miles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable energy ===

==== Background ====
The Trump administration generally prefers fossil fuels to [[Renewable energy in the United States|renewable energy]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In fact, Trump has made his support for the coal industry clear, so much so that his electoral victory in 2016 was celebrated by the coal mining community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/11/11/501749338/trumps-victory-elevates-hopes-for-people-in-coal-country|title=Trump's Victory Elevates Hopes For People In Coal Country|last=Joyce|first=Stephanie|date=November 11, 2016|work=NPR|access-date=June 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, demand for solar and wind energy continues to grow thanks to falling costs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/12/22/506531165/renewable-energy-sector-remains-optimistic-amid-trump-policy-outlook|title=Renewable Energy Sector Remains Optimistic Amid Trump Policy Outlook|last=|first=|date=December 22, 2016|work=NPR|access-date=June 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by coal power plants has fallen due to strong competition from natural gas, wind, and solar power.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; While the traditional fossil fuel industry employed 187,000 jobs in 2016, the wind power industry grew by nearly 32% to 102,000 people. Meanwhile, the solar power industry grew by almost a quarter to 374,000 jobs. In 2017, solar and wind together generated 10% of U.S. electricity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As of 2018, fossil fuels satisfy 80% of U.S. energy demand, according to the EIA.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In any case, the Trump administration has implemented policies that turned out to be favorable for the renewable energy industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Casey|first=Tina|date=January 1, 2018|title=Trump Holds Geothermal Card Up His Sleeve When Pitching “Energy Dominance”|work=CleanTechnica|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/01/trump-holds-geothermal-card-sleeve-pitching-energy-dominance/|url-status=live|access-date=May 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a 2019 CBS News poll on 2,143 U.S. residents, 42% of American adults under 45 years old thought that the U.S. could realistically transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050 while 29% deemed it unrealistic and 29% were unsure. Those numbers for older Americans are 34%, 40%, and 25%, respectively. Differences in opinion might be due to education as younger Americans are more likely to have been taught about climate change in schools than their elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=De Pinto|first=Jennifer|last2=Backus|first2=Fred|date=September 15, 2019|title=Younger Americans views' on climate change: More serious, yet more optimistic|work=CBS News|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/younger-americans-views-on-climate-change-more-serious-yet-more-optimistic/|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2019, only 17% of electricity in the U.S. is generated from renewable energy, of which, 7% is from hydroelectric dams, 6% from wind turbines, and 1% solar panels. The intermittency of wind and solar power poses the issue of storage, and there are no rivers for new dams.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Geothermal ====
[[File:Geothermal resource map US.png|thumb|Estimated subterranean temperatures in Celsius at depths of about six kilometers in the U.S. mainland (Department of Energy).]]Ever since President Trump took office, the Department of Energy has provided funding for the research and development of new ways to harness geothermal energy. In December 2017, the Department's Geothermal Technologies Office began its program to look for cheaper methods of drilling, which account for half the cost of a geothermal power project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Casey|first=Tina|date=January 1, 2018|title=Trump Holds Geothermal Card Up His Sleeve When Pitching “Energy Dominance”|work=CleanTechnica|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/01/trump-holds-geothermal-card-sleeve-pitching-energy-dominance/|url-status=live|access-date=May 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report released in late May 2019 by the Department of Energy suggests that [[Geothermal energy in the United States|U.S. geothermal power]] capacity could increase by more than twenty-six times by 2050, reaching a total installed capacity of 60 GW, thanks to accelerated technological development and adoption. (Also see figure on the left.) The report also demonstrates the benefits of geothermal power for residential and industrial heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=DOE Releases New Study Highlighting the Untapped Potential of Geothermal Energy in the United States|url=https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-new-study-highlighting-untapped-potential-geothermal-energy-united-states|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2019|website=U.S. Department of Energy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced his Department had provided funding for a $140-million research facility at the University of Utah on man-made geothermal energy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In accordance with President Trump's desire for further energy developments in the deserts of California, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) announced in January 2020 it wanted to scale back the amounts of land set aside for conservation, arguing that the footprint of geothermal power plants is compact compared to other types. Some 22,000 acres (89 square kilometers) of land in the southern [[Owens Valley]], what BLM called the Haiwee Geothermal Leasing Area, would be available for lease to geothermal energy projects. The Bureau estimated that this area, with its dormant volcanoes and lava beds, has the potential to spur a billion dollars in investments and to provide 117,000 homes with electricity. Previously, the President ordered BLM to reconsider its Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan in order to expand the amounts of land available for renewable energy and mining projects. This decision attracted praise from the advocates of green energy who argue that the environmental impact of such projects is exaggerated and criticism from conservationists who prefer the Obama-era policy, pointing to the existence of some rare species in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sahagun|first=Louis|date=January 23, 2020|title=Trump team proposes rollback of desert protections to boost geothermal energy|work=Phys.org|department=Environment|url=https://phys.org/news/2020-01-trump-team-rollback-boost-geothermal.html|url-status=live|access-date=May 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hydro ====
In November 2017, the Northern Pass transmission line project, proposed by utilities company [[Eversource Energy|Eversource]] to carry hydroelectricity from Quebec to New England, received a presidential permit. For years, New England has been shedding its coal power plants, and the process continues under President Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bookman|first=Todd|date=November 16, 2017|title=Northern Pass Energy Project Receives Key Federal Approval|work=|url=https://www.nhpr.org/post/northern-pass-energy-project-receives-key-federal-approval#stream/0|url-status=live|access-date=May 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2019, the New Hampshire Supreme Court unanimously upheld the state's Site Evaluation Committee rejection, citing concerns over the land use, environmental and economic impacts of the 192-mile (307-km) transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gheorghiu|first=Iulia|date=July 22, 2019|title=New Hampshire Supreme Court strikes down appeal for Northern Pass transmission permit|work=Utility Dive|url=https://www.utilitydive.com/news/new-hampshire-supreme-court-strikes-down-appeal-for-northern-pass-transmiss/559221/|url-status=live|access-date=May 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, President Trump said he would like the United States to harness more hydropower. However, it is not clear whether he would like to increase hydropower generation or he was unaware of how much hydroelectric dams contribute to the national grid. In any case, while the Energy Information Administration does not expect U.S. hydroelectricity generation to increase in the upcoming years, it is possible to upgrade the turbines of existing facilities as the average U.S. hydroelectric unit has been operating for 64 years. In addition, most dams in the U.S. are not for power generation, but can be fitted with turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=DiChristopher|first=Tom|date=January 10, 2018|title=Trump says he wishes US would use hydropower.

==== Solar ====
[[File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-USA-en.png|thumb|Solar irradiation map of the U.S. mainland in kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2014.]]
Even though President Trump holds critical views of renewable energy in general and solar in particular, his appointees in the Department of the Interior have been facilitating the development of multiple renewable energy projects in public lands.&lt;ref name=":48"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Roth|first=Sammy|date=January 1, 2020|title=Trump administration says it will approve largest U.S. solar farm|work=Los Angeles Times|department=Climate &amp; Environment|url=https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-01-01/trump-to-approve-largest-solar-farm-las-vegas|url-status=live|access-date=May 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2020, the Trump administration gave final approval to the Gemini Solar Farm project in Nevada. Worth a billion dollars, it includes 690 MW of power-generating capacity and 380 MW of four-hour [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]. It is enough to power 260,000 households and offset the greenhouse-gas emissions of 86,000 cars. Secretary of the Interior [[David Bernhardt]] said it would also create 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, and pump $712.5 million into the economy. Gemini, scheduled to enter service by the end of 2023, is the largest solar farm project ever approved in the United States and one of the largest in the world. Opponents argued that the project puts a number of endangered species, such as the Mojave desert tortoise, at risk.&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Beals|first=Rachel Koning|date=May 14, 2020|title=Warren Buffett-backed largest U.S. solar project approved as nation’s renewable use on track to pass coal|work=Market Watch|department=Industries|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffett-backed-largest-us-solar-project-approved-as-nations-renewable-use-on-track-to-pass-coal-2020-05-14|url-status=live|access-date=May 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, two solar farms on public lands were approved: the Sweetwater Project (80 MW) in Wyoming and the Palen Project (500 MW) in California.&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;

In 2018, as part of the ongoing [[China–United States trade war|trade war between the U.S. and China]], Trump imposed tariffs on imported solar cells.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The push for tariffs to protect American manufacturing and jobs in the solar power industry began in April 2017, when a bankrupt Georgia-based solar cell maker filed a trade complaint that a flood of cheap imports put them at a severe disadvantage. In response, the President imposed 30% tariffs of solar imports in January 2018.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The [[Solar power in the United States|solar industry]] is currently one of the fastest growing in the United States, employing more than 250,000 people as of 2018.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; On one hand, these tariffs forced the cancellation or scaling down of many projects and restrict the ability of companies to recruit more workers.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; On the other hand, they have the intended effect of incentivizing domestic manufacturing. Many solar power companies are transitioning towards automation and consequently will become less dependent on imports, especially from China.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-solar-insight/billions-in-u-s-solar-projects-shelved-after-trump-panel-tariff-idUSKCN1J30CT Billions in U.S. solar projects shelved after Trump panel tariff]. Reuters. June 7, 2018. Accessed April 22, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysts believe Trump's tariffs have made a clear impact. Without them, the manufacturing capacity for solar cells in the United States would likely not have increased significantly, from 1.8 gigawatts in 2017 to at least 3.4 gigawatts in 2018, they argue. However, because of the increasing reliance on automation, not that many new jobs will be created, while profits will flow to other countries, as many firms are foreign.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-solar-tariffs-20180530-story.html|title=Trump tariffs are helping more than double U.S. solar capacity|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2018|work=Bloomberg (via the LA Times)|access-date=June 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2019, the solar power industry has recovered from the initial setbacks due to Trump's tariffs, thanks to initiatives from various states, such as California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/after-being-rocked-by-trump-tariffs-the-solar-energy-business-is-bouncing-back.html|title=After being rocked by Trump tariffs, the solar energy business is bouncing back|last=Rogers|first=Kate|date=April 5, 2019|work=CNBC|access-date=June 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is receiving considerable support from the Department of Energy.

Blue, red and purple mean more; yellow and green mean less.|alt=]]Despite Trump's fondness for coal, his administration is not entirely hostile to renewable energy. Interior Secretary [[Ryan Zinke]] wrote in an op-ed for the ''Boston Globe'' that he wanted to provide "an equal opportunity for all sources of responsible energy development, from fossil fuels to the full range of renewables." He added that "wind energy — particularly [[Wind power in the United States#Offshore wind power|offshore wind]] — will play a greater role in sustaining American energy dominance." Zinke wanted to assist developers by allowing them to postpone decisions on detailed designs during the planning process so that they could take advantage of newer technologies.

{{See also|Federal style}}
In February 2020, President Trump proposed an executive order mandating "classical" architecture—including Gothic, Romanesque, Spanish, Mediterranean and other traditional styles—for all federal public buildings in the District of Columbia. Trump and the National Civic Art Society, which was a driving force behind the proposed executive order, and Utah Senator Mike Lee hold a dim view of more modern architectural styles, such as [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalism]], which proved popular during the 1950s but has largely fallen out of favor, used in most federal buildings from the 1950s onward. However, it singled out the Federal Courthouse in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, completed in 2011, for praise. On the other hand, the American Institute of Architects opposed it. Although they agreed that classical styles are "beautiful," they argued that modern building designs must take into account security, new technology, and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Blaire|first=Elizabeth|date=February 13, 2020|title=Just Plain Ugly': Proposed Executive Order Takes Aim At Modern Architecture|work=National Public Radio|department=Architecture|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805256707/just-plain-ugly-proposed-executive-order-takes-aim-at-modern-architecture|url-status=live|access-date=May 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; If signed, the draft order would only apply to federal courthouses, agency headquarters, and other government buildings in the National Capital Region, plus any other federal buildings costing more than $50 million in 2020 values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Slowey|first=Kim|date=February 25, 2020|title=AIA pushes back on possible Trump architecture mandate|work=Construction Dive|url=https://www.constructiondive.com/news/aia-pushes-back-on-possible-trump-architecture-mandate/572866/|url-status=live|access-date=May 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="President Trump prefers classical (left) to modern (right) styles of architecture."&gt;

=== Cybersecurity of critical infrastructure ===
In May 2017, President Trump signed an executive order urging federal agencies to upgrade their antiquated information technology (IT) infrastructure, to draw up plans for coordinated defense, and to comply with cybersecurity standards introduced by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). The order also tackles workforce training in order to provide the United States with a "long-term cybersecurity advantage." For his administration, cybersecurity is a priority because a cyber attack on critical infrastructure could inflict "catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national security." Addressing cybersecurity was a 2016 campaign promise from Trump. However, given that three quarters of the federal budget for IT goes to the operating and maintaining legacy systems, additional funding might be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Eide|first=Naomi|url=https://www.ciodive.com/news/trump-releases-sweeping-order-on-cybersecurity-prioritizing-it-modernizatio/442552/|title=Trump releases sweeping order on cybersecurity prioritizing IT modernization|date=May 11, 2017|work=Cio Dive|access-date=April 8, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== High-speed Internet ===
[[File:Ajit Pai portrait 2018.jpg|thumb|FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.]]
After thinking for a year, President Donald Trump came out against having nationalized fifth-generation wireless internet infrastructure ([[5G]]). [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) Chairman [[Ajit Pai]] said this sent an "important signal" to private companies that were investing billions of dollars in 5G. Pai also proposed spending $20.4 billion over a decade on rural broadband Internet services. Since November 2018, the FCC has been auctioning megahertz of spectrum to commercial wireless internet service providers offering [[5G]] connectivity. FCC Commissioner [[Jessica Rosenworcel]] said this was a step in the right direction and suggested that the Commission should not leave out "mid-band" spectrum lest the U.S. falls behind other countries.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-wireless-trump/trump-says-he-opposes-nationalizing-us-5g-network-idUSKCN1RO1WC|title=Trump says he opposes nationalizing U.S. 5G network|last=Shepardson|first=David|date=April 12, 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=July 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; While previous generations of wireless internet offer the ability to send texts, static images, voice, and video through the Internet, 5G is considerably faster, allowing for high-quality video streaming, [[Self-driving car|driverless cars]], automated ports, remotely-controlled industrial robots, among other things.&lt;ref name="BBC-5G-leap" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article/345387/what-is-5g What Is 5G?].

President Trump made the above announcement as he was considering banning Chinese telecommunications giant [[Huawei]] from the U.S. market. His administration has already been discouraging U.S. allies from purchasing Huawei's 5G technology out of security concerns. His administration believes that Huawei equipment puts intelligence sharing at risk. Since March 2018, the FCC has considered barring the use of federal funds to purchase equipment from companies that could pose a threat to national security.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; By law, companies operating on Chinese soil must "support, cooperate with and collaborate in national intelligence work."&lt;ref name="BBC-5G-leap"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47796528 5G: World's first commercial services promise 'great leap']. BBC News. April 5, 2019. Accessed April 21, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1987, Huawei has since become a leading telecommunications firm, spending 14% of its revenue on research and development each year between 2016 and 2018. However, it has been mired in multiple [[Criticism of Huawei|controversies]] involving alleged intellectual property theft and espionage.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-tn-huawei-5g-trade-war/|title=The Man Behind Huawei|last=|first=|date=April 10, 2019|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=June 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an 11-month investigation, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee found in 2012 that Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese firm, were threats to national security and recommended that U.S. companies refrain from doing business with them.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Under Donald Trump, the U.S. government has been trying to dissuade companies and other governments from around the world from using Huawei's technologies.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In May 2019, the Trump administration added Huawei to the "entity list," which prevents it from acquiring technology from American firms without approval from the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48330310|title=Huawei's use of Android restricted by Google|last=|first=|date=May 20, 2019|work=BBC|access-date=June 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2019, President Trump met with his Finnish counterpart, [[Sauli Niinistö|Sauli Niinisto]], to discuss alternatives to 5G technology from Huawei.

The race was on for the various equipment manufacturers for global dominance, including Huawei and ZTE from China, Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel (both from the U.S.). 5G is a key part of the geopolitical fault lines created by Donald Trump's desire to "make America great again" and China's stated goal of becoming a global hegemony in artificial intelligence by 2030; this technological race is a part of the U.S.-China trade war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/06/a-major-factor-behind-the-us-china-trade-war-is-winning-in-a-crucial-t.html|title=A major factor behind the US-China trade war is winning at a $12 trillion technology — 5G|last=Kharpal|first=Arjun|date=June 6, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=October 14, 2019|department=Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telehealth ===
In late March 2020, President Trump signed into law a stimulus package worth around two trillion dollars, the biggest in American history, in order to alleviate the economic downturn due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]]. Besides cash infusion for front-line hospitals, loans for struggling industries, aid for farmers, enhanced unemployment benefits, relief for married couples with young children, and tax cuts for retailers, it included $200 million for [[Telehealth|telemedicine]]. This would help doctors examine their patients remotely, using video-conferencing technology. At present, the FCC operates a rural healthcare program that subsidizes the use of telecommunications technology. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai personally requested this aid in early March.&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Emma|first=Caitlin|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/whats-in-stimulus-package-coronavirus-149282|title=Here's what's in the $2 trillion stimulus package — and what's next|date=March 25, 2020|work=Politico|access-date=April 8, 2020|url-status=live|last2=Scholtes|first2=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early that month, the President signed a bipartisan bill that extended Medicare coverage to include telemedicine in outbreak areas. Previously, it was restricted to rural residents who had to take long trips to see a doctor. Telemedicine reduces the need for travel, and therefore chances of vulnerable senior citizens catching COVID-19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Alonso-Zaldivar|first=Ricardo|url=https://apnews.com/cd2b26c1d52f27146aad011b07a5f245|title=As coronavirus spreads, Medicare gets telemedicine option|date=March 6, 2020|work=Associated Press|access-date=April 14, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canals, ports, and harbors ===
The America's Water Infrastructure Act, signed into law by President Trump in October 2018 authorizes $6 billion in spending. Potential recipients for federal funding include the Houston-Galveston Navigation Channel Extension ($15.6 million), and the [[Ala Wai Canal]] project in Hawaii ($306.5 million). This bill includes a five-year "Buy American" provision, which requires the use of American-made construction materials used by projects funded by the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Slowey|first=Kim|date=October 26, 2018|title=Trump authorizes $6B of water infrastructure projects|work=Construction Dive|url=https://www.constructiondive.com/news/trump-authorizes-6b-of-water-infrastructure-projects/540576/|url-status=live|access-date=May 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after taking office in 2017, Donald Trump unveiled an infrastructure plan worth a trillion dollars that includes a $2.4-billion cut to federal transportation programs. This plan would eliminate subsidies for long-distance trains and commercial flights to rural communities with limited transportation options, including those that helped Trump win the presidency. He wanted to relieve the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) of air traffic control and to turn it into a private nonprofit corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article138839948.html Trump proposes deep transportation cuts in rural regions that supported him]. McClathcy DC Bureau. March 16, 2017. Accessed February 14, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2019, the FAA announced it was giving out $840 million in grants for improving airport facilities and President Trump proposed $17.1 billion in funding for the FAA. Trump's proposal made it through the House Appropriations Committee with $614 million more than requested. Therefore, the FAA had $17.7 billion to spend. [[Airport Improvement Program]]s (AIP) funds will go to over 380 airports in 47 states. One of the biggest grants is worth $29 million, which goes to runway reconstruction at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] in Alaska. In addition, the House Appropriations Committee announced $3.3 billion in AIP grants to be handed out in 2020, plus $500 million for discretionary airport infrastructure spending.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.constructiondive.com/news/faa-sees-177b-proposed-for-2020-allocates-840m-grants/556603/|title=FAA sees $17.7B proposed for 2020, allocates $840M grants|last=Slowey|first=Kim|date=June 11, 2019|work=Construction Dive|access-date=June 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some airliners themselves have been financing airport capital projects on their own. For example, [[American Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] have committed $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, to modernize the facilities they use at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX). Delta allocated another four billion dollars to the construction of a new terminal at the [[LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia International Airport]] in New York City. At the same time, a number of airports are willing to spend money on their own facilities in order to reap the long-term economic benefits. In May 2019, the [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]] (DFW) announced it would spend some $3.5 billion on a new terminal and on renovating an existing terminal for American Airlines, which uses the airport as one of its main hubs in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

In early 2020, American airports saw their passenger numbers plummet due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. To help them cope with the crisis, the Trump administration provided $10 billion in financial aid with Congressional approval.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

===Public transportation===
In 2018, the Trump administration rolled out an infrastructure plan that allocates one quarter of the money available to rural areas, even though only 14% of Americans live there. This spells trouble for numerous large-scale urban projects and undermines aging [[Public transit|transit]] networks in large established cities such as Chicago or New York City, which need significant funds for repairs, maintenance, and modernization, because it favors new construction.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This does not mean such cities have no need or plans for transit expansions. See, for example, the Chicago "L" [[Chicago "L"#Red Line extension|Red Line Extension]].&lt;/ref&gt; Another key aspect of this policy is that it relegates primary funding responsibility to local authorities and the private sector. Trump's aim with this funding policy is to realize his promise during the 2016 presidential campaign to bring jobs to rural areas, where employment prospects have been dim, and to transfer wealth from states that tend to vote Democrat to those that helped him win the election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/12/trump-infrastructure-blue-states-transit-405993 Trump takes aim at blue states in infrastructure plan]. Politico. February 12, 2018. Accessed February 10, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an analysis of data from the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] by McClatchy, the Trump administration has been prioritizing rural transportation projects. Whereas the Obama administration directed 80% of the money from the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program to urban projects, under Trump, rural areas got 70% in funding, as of 2019.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article231720058.html|title=Trump states and rural areas grab bigger chunk of transportation grant funds|last=|first=|date=June 21, 2019|work=McClatchy DC Bureau|access-date=June 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, funding for a proposed [[KC Streetcar|Kansas City Streetcar]] extension was rejected twice by the Trump administration, but money for a highway [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] in nearby [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]], turned down by the Obama administration, was granted. The Trump administration explained that this shift in priorities is to give rural areas their "fair share" in funding for transportation projects and to re-balance the "historic under-investment in rural America." In fact, while South Carolina received only 15% of what they requested under Obama, under Trump, they received 100%. Moreover, Alaska, Nebraska, Arkansas and Wyoming received more funding in the first two years of Donald Trump than they did under the entire presidency of Barack Obama whereas California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Washington, New York and Illinois, states where Hillary Clinton won, got considerably less money.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; [[File:Construction at Hudson Yards (14794824672).jpg|thumb|360x360px|Construction at Hudson Yards, Manhattan, New York City.|alt=]]

The [[Gateway Program (Northeast Corridor)|Gateway Program]] is a plan to modernize railroad infrastructure between New York and New Jersey and to double the number of trains passing between those two states. This plan includes repairs to the old North River Tunnel, and the construction of the new Hudson Tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nec.amtrak.com/project/the-gateway-program/ The Gateway Program].

Under the plan, the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[IRT Flushing Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Flushing}}, currently connecting [[Flushing, Queens]], to [[Hudson Yards (neighborhood), Manhattan|Hudson Yards, Manhattan]]) would go under the Hudson River to an intermodal terminal in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]]. It was estimated to cost $6 billion in 2013, half of that of the Gateway program. However, it may not be enough as a replacement for Gateway.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; In late June 2019, the state governments of New York and New Jersey passed legislation to create the bi-state Gateway Development Commission, whose job it is to oversee the planning, funding and construction of the rail tunnels and bridges of Gateway Program. This bill stipulates that each state is responsible for 50% of the funding and creates standards for transparency and accountability. The Commission is capable of receiving funds from federal, state, and local sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/infrastructure/article/21085913/bistate-legislation-passed-to-establish-gateway-development-commission|title=Bi-state legislation passed to establish Gateway Development Commission|last=Wanek-Libman|first=Mischa|date=June 24, 2019|work=Mass Transit Magazine|access-date=June 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the Gateway Program is the [[Portal Bridge]] Replacement Project. Going over the Hackensack River in Northern New Jersey, the Portal Bridge is a two-track moveable [[Swing bridge|swing-span]] rail bridge that is a key piece of infrastructure in the Northeast Corridor. According to Amtrak and NJ Transit, intercity and regional trains carrying a total of 150,000 to 200,000 passengers cross the bridge each weekday. However, because the Portal Bridge is over a century old, it does not always function properly. Delays arise when the bridge fails to close completely.&lt;ref name=":46"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Porter|first=David|date=November 15, 2014|title=New Jersey’s Portal Bridge, bane of the Northeast Corridor, is due for upgrade|work=The Washington Post|department=Politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-jerseys-portal-bridge-bane-of-the-northeast-corridor-is-due-for-upgrade/2014/11/15/36c34662-6d1e-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html|url-status=live|access-date=May 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amtrak and NJ Transit reported that between 2014 and 2018, 85 delays occurred, each lasting for two hours at least.&lt;ref name=":47"&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=February 11, 2020|title=New Jersey’s Portal Bridge OK’d For Federal Funds, But Gateway Project Doesn’t Make Cut|work=CBS New York|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/02/11/portal-bridge-gateway-project-funding/|url-status=live|access-date=May 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proposed replacement would be a fixed structure standing 50 feet (15.24 meters) above mean high water, or twice the current height, thereby eliminating the need for openings.

[[File:Vladimir_Putin_%26_Donald_Trump_in_Helsinki,_16_July_2018_(3).jpg|thumb|right|287px|Trump's personal first use of the phrase on Twitter occurred on July 18, 2018, when he tweeted that people with the "syndrome" would rather go to war than be content with him getting along well with Putin at the [[2018 Russia–United States summit|2018 summit]].&lt;ref name="Zorn_7/31/2018"/&gt;]]

'''Trump derangement syndrome''' ('''TDS''') is a term for criticism or negative reactions to United States President [[Donald Trump]] that are perceived to be irrational, and have little regard towards Trump's actual policy positions, or actions undertaken by his administration.&lt;ref name="Cillizza"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/politics/trump-derangement-syndrome/index.html|title=What is 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'—and do you have it?|last=Cillizza|first=Chris|date=July 19, 2018|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=July 21, 2018|author-link=Chris Cillizza}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used by Trump supporters to discredit criticism of his actions, as a way of [[Framing (social sciences)|reframing]] the discussion by suggesting that his opponents are incapable of accurately perceiving the world.&lt;ref name="Flaherty"&gt;{{cite news |last=Flaherty |first=Anne |date=July 18, 2018 |title=Trump's diagnosis for critics: 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://www.apnews.com/48225d1360864dcb861b12e5cda12a32 |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zorn_7/31/2018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-perspec-zorn-trump-derangement-syndrome-20180801-story.html|title='Trump Derangement Syndrome' afflicts supporters more than critics of the president|last=Zorn|first=Eric|date=July 31, 2018|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=|author-link=Eric Zorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/opinion/columnists/democrats-midterms-progressive-left-trump.html|title='Trump Derangement Syndrome' Is a Myth|last=Leonhardt|first=David|date=September 16, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=|author-link=David Leonhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==

The origin of the term is traced to political columnist and commentator [[Charles Krauthammer]], a psychiatrist, who originally coined the phrase [[Bush derangement syndrome]] in 2003 during the [[presidency of George W. Bush]]. That "syndrome" was defined by Krauthammer as "the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency—nay—the very existence of George W. Bush".&lt;ref name="DavisSyndrome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/03/trump-derangement-syndrome/|title=Trump Derangement Syndrome|last1=Davis|first1=Michael|date=March 26, 2016|work=[[The Spectator]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CostPresidency"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/12/united-states-constitution-congress-legislative-authority-tame-imperial-presidency/|title=Taming the Imperial Presidency|last1=Cost|first1=Jay|date=December 4, 2017|work=[[National Review]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KrauthammerBush"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2003/12/05/the-delusional-dean/cbc80426-08ee-40fd-97e5-19da55fdc821/|title=The Delusional Dean|last1=Krauthammer|first1=Charles|date=December 5, 2003|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018|author-link=Charles Krauthammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KrauthammerPost"/&gt; The first use of the term "Trump Derangement Syndrome" may have been by Esther Goldberg in an August 2015 [[op-ed]] in ''[[The American Spectator]]''; she applied the term to "Ruling Class Republicans" who are dismissive or contemptuous of Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spectator.org/63786_trump-derangement-syndrome/|title=Trump Derangement Syndrome|last=Goldberg|first=Esther|date=August 17, 2015|work=[[The American Spectator]]|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krauthammer,  in an op-ed harshly criticizing Trump, commented that—in addition to general hysteria about Trump—the "Trump Derangement Syndrome" was the "inability to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and{{nbsp}}... signs of psychic pathology" in his behavior.&lt;ref name="KrauthammerPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/06/you_cant_govern_by_id_charles.html|title=You can't govern by ID|last1=Krauthammer|first1=Charles|date=June 9, 2017|work=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018|author-link=Charles Krauthammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

[[Fareed Zakaria]] defined the syndrome as "hatred of President Trump so intense that it impairs people's judgment".&lt;ref name="ZakariaAvoid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/04/16/fareed-take-trump-derangement-syndrome.cnn |title=Fareed: Is 'Trump derangement syndrome' real? |last1=Zakaria |first1=Fareed |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=April 16, 2017 |access-date=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's [[editor-at-large]] [[Chris Cillizza]] called TDS "the preferred nomenclature of Trump defenders who view those who oppose him and his policies as nothing more than the blind hatred of those who preach tolerance and free speech".&lt;ref name="Cillizza"/&gt; Pointing to previous allegations of [[Bush Derangement Syndrome]] and Obama Derangement Syndrome, Cillizza suggested, "Viewed more broadly, the rise of presidential derangement syndromes is a function of increased polarization—not to mention our national self-sorting—at work in the country today."&lt;ref name="Cillizza"/&gt; [[Bret Stephens]] has described the term as something used by conservative groups whenever someone speaks out critically against Trump, regardless of political affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4675860/donald-trump-fake-news-attacks/|title=Don't Dismiss President Trump's Attacks on the Media as Mere Stupidity|last=Stephens|first=Bret|date=February 26, 2017|work=Time|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

The term has been widely applied by pro-Trump writers to critics of Trump, accusing them of responding negatively to a wide range of Trump's statements and actions.&lt;ref name="TobinCoughlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/trump-isnt-father-coughlin/|title=Trump Isn't Father Coughlin|last1=Tobin|first1=Jonathan|date=May 4, 2018|work=[[National Review]]|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GopnikPersistence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The use of the term has been called part of a broader [[GOP]] strategy to discredit criticisms of Trump's actions, as a way of "reframing" the discussion by suggesting his political opponents are incapable of accurately perceiving the world. However, according to [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] of [[Annenberg Public Policy Center]], the term could backfire on Trump supporters because people might interpret it to mean that Trump is the one who is "deranged", rather than those who criticize him.&lt;ref name="Flaherty" /&gt; Some Trump supporters have asserted that he plays a form of "multi-dimensional chess" on a mental level his critics cannot comprehend, which they say explains why critics are frustrated and confused by Trump's words and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-isnt-playing-3d-chess-hes-playing-ultimate-tic-tac-toe/|title=Trump Isn't Playing 3D Chess—He's Playing Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe|first=Oliver|last=Roeder|date=May 7, 2018|website=Five Thirty Eight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/magazine/the-enduring-appeal-of-seeing-trump-as-chess-master-in-chief.html|title=The Enduring Appeal of Seeing Trump as Chess Master in Chief|first=John|last=Herrman|date=May 31, 2017|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/30/trump-is-losing-his-own-3d-chess-game/|title=Trump Is Losing His Own 3D Chess Game|first=Phil|last=Levy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/08/politics/trump-corker-attack/index.html|title=Donald Trump is playing zero-dimensional chess|first=Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN|last=Editor-at-large|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News anchor [[Bret Baier]] and former House speaker [[Paul Ryan]] have characterized Trump as a "troll" who makes controversial statements to see his adversaries' "heads explode".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/tv/bret-baier-trump-likes-trolling-the-left-to-watch-heads-explode-even-if-he-contradicts-himself/|title=Bret Baier: Trump Likes Trolling the Left to Watch 'Heads Explode', Even If He Contradicts Himself|date=July 24, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/magazine/paul-ryan-speakership-end-trump.html|title=This Is the Way Paul Ryan's Speakership Ends|first=Mark|last=Leibovich|date=August 7, 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of use===

Senator [[Rand Paul]] has cited the so-called syndrome several times. In a July 16, 2018, interview he said investigators should simply focus on election security and stop "accusing Trump of collusion with the Russians and all this craziness that's not true"—accusations which he said were entirely motivated by "Trump derangement syndrome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/rand-paul-donald-trump-russia-cnntv/index.html|title=Rand Paul dismisses focus on election attack as 'Trump derangement syndrome'|last=Watkins|first=Eli|date=July 16, 2018|work=CNN|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump used the term in a tweet following the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]] in [[Helsinki]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/18/summit-critics-trump-derangement-syndrome-putin|title=Summit critics have Trump derangement syndrome—says Trump|last1=Smith|first1=David|date=July 18, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also used it in a tweet about [[Alan Dershowitz]]'s book ''The Case Against Impeaching Trump'':
{{tweet|block=yes|text=.@AlanDersh, a brilliant lawyer, who although a Liberal Democrat who probably didn't vote for me, has discussed the Witch Hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way.

In July 2018, [[Jeanine Pirro]] accused [[Whoopi Goldberg]] of suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome during a guest appearance on ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' to promote her newly published book. This occurred while Pirro was responding to a question about how the "[[deep state]]" really works.&lt;ref&gt;Meagan Flynn, ''The Washington Post'', [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/07/20/whoopi-vs-judge-jeanine-trump-derangement-syndrome-comment-sparks-yelling-match-on-the-view/ Whoopi vs. Judge Jeanine: 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' comment sparks yelling match on 'The View'], July 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, [[Eric Zorn]] wrote in the ''Chicago Tribune'' that the syndrome afflicts Trump's supporters more than his critics, as "what Team Trump is calling derangement is, in most cases, rational concern about his behavior and the direction he's taking the country.... The true Trump Derangement Syndrome loose on the land is the delusion suffered by those who still think he's going to make this country a better place for average people."&lt;ref name="Zorn_7/31/2018"/&gt;

[[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] also used the term in this tweet:

In September 2018, [[Fox News]] personality and Trump supporter, [[Sean Hannity]] criticized ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as having Trump Derangement Syndrome for stating in an editorial that Trump, because of his attitude toward climate change, is "complicit" in hurricanes battering the United States;&lt;ref name="insider.foxnews.com"&gt;[http://insider.foxnews.com/amp/article/63225 Hannity: 'Trump Derangement Syndrome Reaches New Heights' With WaPo Headline on Trump &amp; Hurricanes] Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/another-hurricane-is-about-to-batter-our-coast-trump-is-complicit/2018/09/11/ccaed766-b5fb-11e8-a7b5-adaaa5b2a57f_story.html Another hurricane is about to batter our coast.

In November 2018, Michael Goodwin, writing in the ''[[New York Post]]'', discussed a variant of Trump Derangement syndrome he called "Trump Imitation Syndrome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2018/11/20/trump-imitation-syndrome-is-afflicting-the-presidents-liberal-enemies|title='Trump Imitation Syndrome' is afflicting the president's liberal enemies|date=November 21, 2018|website=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2019, [[Anthony Scaramucci]], Trump's former [[White House Communications Director]], said in interviews with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and [[CNN]] that he had "Trump fatigue syndrome" instead of Trump derangement syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cohan |first=William D. |date=August 16, 2009 |title='Oh My God, This Jackass': The Mooch Explains Why He Thinks Trump Is 'Crazy', 'Narcissistic', and a 'Paper Tiger' Who Will Drop Out by March 2020 |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/anthony-scaramucci-interview-trump |quote=I don't have Trump derangement syndrome, but what I do have is Trump fatigue syndrome.

In September 2019, Sean Hannity characterized as "Trump derangement syndrome" the continuing press coverage of Trump's days-long insistence that he was correct to state on September{{nbsp}}1 that [[Veracity of statements by Donald Trump#Hurricane Dorian|Hurricane Dorian]] posed a danger to [[Alabama]], asserting "pretty much every newsroom in America screwed this up and lied to you," adding there were "a lot of psychotic jackasses in the media mob".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/sean-hannity/defending-trumps-lie-about-alabama-and-dorian-peak-sean-hannity|title=Defending Trump's lie about Alabama and Dorian is peak Sean Hannity|first=Matt|last=Gertz|website=Media Matters for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Special Counsel Mueller's Report ====

The [[Mueller Report|report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller]], released on April 18, 2019, found that soon after the firing of James Comey and the appointment of the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel]], Trump "engaged in conduct{{nbsp}}... involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public acts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mueller Report |date=2019 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-9821-2973-6 |pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mueller Report found "multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |pages=419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Mueller Report found "substantial evidence" or "evidence" that:
* "The President's attempts to remove the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel]] were linked to the Special Counsel's oversight of investigations that involved the President's conduct";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The President's effort to have (Attorney General) Sessions limit the scope of the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel's investigation]] to future election interference was intended to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President's and his campaign's conduct";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "In repeatedly urging (White House counsel Donald) McGahn to dispute that he was ordered to have the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel]] terminated, the President acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn's account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President's conduct towards the investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "... at least one purpose of the President's conduct towards (Attorney General) Jeff Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a way that would restrict its scope{{nbsp}}... A reasonable inference{{nbsp}}... is that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "... could support the inference that the President intended to discourage (attorney Michael) Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen's information would shed adverse light on the President's campaign-period conduct and statements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "... the President's actions had the potential to influence (campaign adviser Paul) Manafort's decision on whether to cooperate with the government{{nbsp}}... The President's public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury deliberations also had the potential to influence the trial jury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel Robert Mueller]] concluded that "The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Mueller Report made no definitive conclusion as to whether Trump had committed criminal obstruction of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mueller/mueller-says-he-did-not-exonerate-trump-us-policy-precluded-charges-idUSKCN1UJ0DF |title=Mueller says Trump was not exonerated; Trump declares victory |last=Morgan |first=David |date=July 24, 2019 |work=Reuters |last2=Wolfe |first2=Jan |access-date=July 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727133528/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mueller/mueller-says-he-did-not-exonerate-trump-us-policy-precluded-charges-idUSKCN1UJ0DF|archive-date=July 27, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel]] strongly hinted that it was up to Congress to make such a determination based on the evidence presented in the report.

In 2018, Florida businessmen [[Lev Parnas]] and [[Igor Fruman]] hired Trump's personal attorney [[Rudy Giuliani]] as a consultant in their security company, paying him $500,000.

From at least May 2019 to August 2019, Trump and Giuliani pressed the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation that would have negatively affected Trump's political rival Joe Biden in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. Giuliani and his associates asked Ukraine president [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] to announce an investigation into the business activities of [[Hunter Biden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/29/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-biden-trump-impeachment|title=Rudy Giuliani: Ukraine sources detail attempt to construct case against Biden|last1=Pilkington|first1=Ed|last2=Roth|first2=Andrew|date=September 29, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure tactics were developed by Giuliani and [[Gordon Sondland]] and applied in part by Parnas and Fruman.

[[Anton Herashchenko]], a senior advisor to the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ukraine interior minister]], told ''The Daily Beast'' that Ukraine will open such an investigation if there is an official request, along with details of why an investigation is needed and what to look for; Trump's requests had come through unofficial representatives such as Giuliani.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/20/trump-urged-ukraine-president-to-investigate-joe-bidens-son.html |title=Trump urged Ukraine president eight times during call to investigate Joe Biden's son, report says |last=Mangan |first=Dan |date=September 20, 2019 |accessdate=September 29, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920194258/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/20/trump-urged-ukraine-president-to-investigate-joe-bidens-son.html|archive-date=September 20, 2019 |publisher=[[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview released on September 24, Ukrainian diplomat and politician [[Valentyn Nalyvaichenko]] told ''The Daily Beast'' that Ukrainian authorities would be reopening corruption investigations into multiple individuals and organizations including, potentially, Burisma, Trump campaign manager [[Paul Manafort]], TV host [[Larry King]], and former prosecutor [[Yuriy Lutsenko]]. King was suspected of having received [[slush fund]] payments recorded in the "black ledger" that also named Manafort.

The House Intelligence Committee would focus on the contents of the whistleblower complaint and whether the complaint may have been wrongfully hidden from Congress, while the Foreign Affairs Committee would focus on interactions the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] may have had with the president's personal attorney Giuliani, and the Oversight and Reform Committee would investigate whether White House classification systems were used to secure potentially damaging records of phone calls between the president and other world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/09/29/democrats-impeachment-messaging-donald-trump-010934 |title=Dem leaders plot impeachment messaging war with Trump |last=Ferris |first=Sarah |date=September 29, 2019 |website=Politico|accessdate=September 30, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Requests for evidence and White House refusal ===

On September 27, 2019, a subpoena was issued by the House to obtain documents Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] had refused to release earlier. Said documents include several interactions between Trump, Giuliani, and Ukrainian government officials. The documents were requested to be filed with the involved committees probing the issue; the failure to do so "shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry", as stated in a letter written to Pompeo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/09/27/democrats-subpoena-pompeo-as-part-of-impeachment-inquiry-000159 |title=Democrats subpoena Pompeo as part of impeachment inquiry |last=Cheney |first=Kyle |date=September 27, 2019 |website=Politico |accessdate=September 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subpoena came after several requests by the House to receive the documents from the Secretary which he did not fulfill.

On October 8, 2019, in a letter from White House Counsel [[Pat Cipollone]] to House Speaker Pelosi and the three committee chairmen conducting the impeachment investigation, the White House announced that it would not cooperate with the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-letter-to-nancy-pelosi-white-house-wont-cooperate-with-house-impeachment-inquiry-testimony-documents/ |title=White House won't cooperate with House impeachment inquiry, counsel says |last=Segers |first=Grace |date=October 9, 2019 |work=CBS News |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, Cipollone said the investigation "violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/10/09/768540896/who-sets-the-rules-when-is-it-real-and-other-big-questions-on-impeachment |title=Fact Check: White House Legal Argument Against Impeachment Inquiry |last=Naylor |first=Brian |date=October 9, 2019 |work=NPR |access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "The President cannot allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the Executive Branch."&lt;ref name=unhinged&gt;{{cite news |title=It's tempting to ignore Trump's unhinged letter to Congress.

In past impeachment probes, Congress has treated an obstruction of DOJ and Congressional investigations as an article of impeachment, either along with other alleged offenses (Johnson, Nixon) or even as its sole basis for articles of impeachment (Clinton).

Giuliani's attorney, Jim A. Sale, sent a letter to the House Intelligence Committee on October 15, 2019, stating that Giuliani would not provide documents subpoenaed by the committee. Citing [[Attorney–client privilege|attorney–client]] and [[executive privilege]], the letter characterized the subpoena as "beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/giuliani-subpoena-ukraine.html |title=Giuliani Defies Subpoena for Ukraine Documents |last=Shear |first=Michael D. |date=October 15, 2019 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 16, 2019 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Opening statement of Ambassador William B. Taylor (searchable).pdf|thumb|upright|Ambassador [[William B. Taylor Jr.|Bill Taylor]]'s opening statement to his testimony before three House committees, October 22, 2019]]

On October 22, 2019, [[William B. Taylor Jr.|Bill Taylor]], the senior U.S. diplomatic official in Ukraine, testified to Congressional investigators. Taylor testified that he had learned in mid-July 2019 that a potential White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky "was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections", and that he later was told, in September 2019, that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was also dependent on such investigations—including into the Bidens.&lt;ref name="bade"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bade |first1=Rachel |last2=Gearan |first2=Anne |last3=Demirjan |first3=Karoun |last4=DeBonis |first4=Mike |title=Trump made Ukraine aid contingent on public pledge to investigate Bidens and 2016 election, U.S. envoy says he was told |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/diplomat-who-raised-alarm-about-withholding-aid-to-ukraine-testifies-in-impeachment-probe/2019/10/22/086fb850-f436-11e9-8cf0-4cc99f74d127_story.html |date=October 22, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=October 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wu |first1=Nicholas |last2=Jansen |first2=Bart |title=Key takeaways from Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor's 'explosive' opening statement |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/22/impeachment-takeaways-ukraine-diplomat-bill-taylors-testimony/2450332001/ |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Faulders |first1=Katherine |title=Top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine tells Congress investigating Bidens and election interference tied to aid money |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-us-diplomat-ukraine-tells-congress-investigating-bidens/story?id=66451155 |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=[[ABC News]] |date=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor testified that, alongside the "regular, formal diplomatic processes" with Ukraine led by himself, there was a "highly irregular", "informal channel of U.S. policy-making" concerning Ukraine. The informal channel began in May 2019, being "guided" by Giuliani, and also involving Volker, Sondland and Perry. Taylor said that by August 2019 he had realized the informal channel "was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy", while the formal channel wanted "a strong U.S.–Ukraine partnership". According to Taylor, the informal channel had "driven" the idea of a White House meeting between the presidents being conditional on the investigations.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Jaffe |first1=Greg |last2=Miller |first2=Greg |title='Alarming circumstances': A distressed diplomat tells a tale of venal intrigue |date=October 23, 2019 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/alarming-circumstances-a-distressed-diplomat-tells-a-tale-of-venal-intrigue/2019/10/22/935b23c6-f500-11e9-ad8b-85e2aa00b5ce_story.html |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor noted that, during a June 2019 call between himself, Zelensky, Sondland, Volker and Perry; Sondland had said "he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants" and that "he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring." As for Trump's July 2019 call with Zelensky, Taylor said he did not receive any report regarding the call from the White House even though he was scheduled to meet Zelensky a day later.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;

Taylor said he heard from NSC aide [[Tim Morrison (arms control expert)|Tim Morrison]] that, on September 1, Sondland told Zelensky aide {{ill|Andrey Yermak|WD=Q65200615|vertical-align=sup}} that the military aid to Ukraine was dependent on Zelensky's pursuit of the Burisma investigation. Taylor cited Sondland's telling him in a call that Trump wanted Zelensky to publicly announce he would order the two investigations, thus placing Zelensky "in a public box". Taylor quoted Sondland as saying "everything" including military aid and a Trump–Zelensky meeting was contingent upon that announcement.&lt;ref name=":3b"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/us/politics/william-taylor-testimony.html |title=6 Key Revelations of Taylor's Opening Statement to Impeachment Investigators |last=LaFraniere |first=Sharon |authorlink=Sharon LaFraniere |date=October 22, 2019 |work=The New York Times |access-date=October 23, 2019|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=5 takeaways from William Taylor's huge opening statement |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/22/takeaways-bill-taylors-crucial-opening-statement/ |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Taylor, he wrote a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo on advice from Bolton: "I wrote and transmitted such a cable on August 29, describing the 'folly' I saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian government. I told the secretary that I could not and would not defend such a policy." Taylor reported that Pompeo gave no reply to his cable.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;

The House Judiciary Committee asked to see secret [[grand jury]] information that had been used in compiling the Mueller Report.

On October 29, 2019, the NSC's head of European Affairs, Lieutenant Colonel [[Alexander Vindman]], testified before the House committees, stating he had overheard Trump's phone conversation with the Ukrainian President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/10/29/purple-heart-ranger-tab-fao-meet-the-army-officer-testifying-about-trumps-ukraine-call/ |title=Purple Heart, Ranger tab, FAO: Meet the Army officer testifying about Trump's Ukraine call |first=Kyle |last=Rempfer |date=October 29, 2019 |website=Army Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/extremely-disturbing-top-dems-alarmed-over-vindman-s-testimony-trump-n1073371 |title='Extremely disturbing': Top Democrats alarmed over Vindman's testimony on Trump–Ukraine call |website=NBC News |date=October 29, 2019 |first=Adam |last=Edelman |first2=Rebecca |last2=Shabad |accessdate=November 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had released his opening statement the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/29/us/politics/vindman-statement-impeachment.html |title=Read Alexander Vindman's Opening Statement on Trump and Ukraine |last= |first= |date=October 29, 2019 |website=The New York Times |access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vindman testified: "In Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false and alternative narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency, [which was] harmful to U.S. national security [and also] undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine."&lt;ref name="npr vindman"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Amita |last=Kelly |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/10/28/774256868/read-ukraine-expert-lt-col-alexander-vindmans-opening-statement |title=Read: Ukraine Expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's Opening Statement |website=NPR |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vindman said that, additionally, he was concerned by two events, both of which he objected to senior officials in real-time, and which he reported to the NSC's lead attorney. The first event occurred at a July 10 meeting between Ukraine's then [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|Secretary of National Security and Defense Council]] [[Oleksandr Danylyuk|Oleksandr Danlylyuk]], and then U.S. National Security Advisor Bolton, at which Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, and Secretary Perry were in attendance. At the meeting, Sondland asked Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens to get a meeting with President Trump. Vindman states that Bolton cut the meeting short, and that both he and Fiona Hill told Ambassador Sondland his comments were inappropriate, and that he reported the concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 29, 2019 |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/read-national-security-official-alexander-s-vindman-s-prepared-remarks-n1073156 |title=Read national security official Alexander S. Vindman's prepared remarks to Congress |website=NBC News |language=en|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second event occurred on a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Zelensky. Vindman states, "I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security." Vindman also reported this event to Eisenberg, the NSC's lead counsel.&lt;ref name="npr vindman" /&gt; Vindman also testified that the "rough transcript" of the call released by the White House omitted crucial words and phrases, including Trump asserting recordings of Joe Biden discussing Ukraine corruption exist, which Trump stated in the third set of [[ellipsis|ellipses]] in the released transcript. Vindman said he had tried but failed to restore the full transcript.&lt;ref name="corrected"/&gt; A senior White House official had asserted when the transcript was released that the ellipses "do not indicate missing words or phrases", but rather "a trailing off of a voice or pause".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry-09-25-2019/h_08149725b4b299fa4849b4fd8afb3ecb |title=Here's why there are ellipses in the White House transcript |date=September 25, 2019 |website=[[CNN]] |first=Pamela |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump had previously characterized the released transcript as "an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/03/odd-markings-ellipses-fuel-doubts-about-rough-transcript-trumps-ukraine-call/ |date=October 2, 2019 |title=Odd markings, ellipses fuel doubts about the rough transcript of Trump's Ukraine call |first1=Carol D. |last1=Leonnig |first2=Craig |last2=Timberg |first3=Drew |last3=Harwell |website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2019, [[Catherine Croft]], a State Department Ukraine expert and NSC staff member testified. She noted in her opening statement that she was aware of Giuliani's communication with Volker, though she was not involved with those discussions, that former Republican lawmaker [[Bob Livingston]] repeatedly called her to promote the removal of Ambassador [[Marie Yovanovitch|Yovanovitch]]. She added: "On July 18, I participated in a sub-Policy Coordination Committee video conference where an [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB)] representative reported that the White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to Ukraine.

Tim Morrison, an official on the NSC, testified in a closed-door session on October 31. Morrison corroborated previous testimony by [[William B. Taylor Jr.|Bill Taylor]], saying Taylor had been "accurate" on the "substance" of their conversations, but there were two differences in the details, the first being a location of a meeting. Regarding the second difference, Morrison testified that in his September{{nbsp}}1 conversation with Sondland, he learned that Sondland had proposed to Ukrainian presidential advisor Andriy Yermak that military aid to Ukraine was "conditioned on a public statement" by the new Ukrainian prosecutor general's reopening an investigation into Burisma. (Taylor's testimony was that Zelensky should make the announcement.)&lt;ref name=Leonnig-191031 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fandos |first1=Nicholas |title=White House Aide Confirms He Saw Signs of a Quid Pro Quo on Ukraine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/morrison-testimony-impeachment.html |accessdate=November 3, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 31, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20191031192539/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/morrison-testimony-impeachment.html |archivedate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=House |first1=Billy |title=White House Aide Tells House of Concerns Over Trump and Ukraine |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-11-01/white-house-aide-tells-house-of-concerns-over-trump-and-ukraine |accessdate=November 3, 2019 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Treene |first1=Alayna |last2=Ayesh |first2=Rashaan |title=Former White House official confirms top Ukraine diplomat's testimony |url=https://www.axios.com/white-house-tim-morrison-diplomat-testimony-c77aa24b-ccf6-46f0-bad5-199d45e434e7.html |accessdate=November 3, 2019 |work=[[Axios]] |date=November 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison also discussed the July 2019 Trump–Zelensky call, having listened to the call himself.

[[File:David-Holmes-Opening-Statement.pdf|thumb|upright|David Holmes's opening statement to his deposition on November 15, 2019]]

On November 15, David Holmes, a U.S. Department of State foreign service officer who works at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, and serves as an aide to Bill Taylor, testified in a closed-door session before three House committees that he and two unnamed aides overheard a phone conversation between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump, while at a restaurant in Kyiv, and immediately following a private meeting between President Zelensky and Sondland, where Trump asked Sondland about whether or not the Ukrainian President had agreed to investigate the Bidens.&lt;ref name=holmesdeposition&gt;{{cite news |first=Alayna |date=November 14, 2019 |last=Treene |url=https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-impeachment-david-holmes-mark-sandy-67051991-a73a-4bd1-aa45-e02566ff35c6.html|title=House committees request new closed-door impeachment testimony from U.S. official in Ukraine|website=Axios}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes' statement provided the first testimony under oath that Trump directly and contemporaneously requested investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden and Burisma, with Trump allegedly asking "so he's gonna do the investigation?", refuting the potential defense that Trump had not been involved, and that Sondland might have been acting without the president's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/david-holmes-confirms-trump-asked-about-ukraine-investigation.html|title=Aide Confirms Trump Asked About Ukraine Investigation, Delivering Blow to GOP Defense|last=Politi|first=Daniel|date=November 16, 2019|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Holmes' deposition raised questions about the credibility, accuracy, and truthfulness of Ambassador Sondland's previous sworn deposition, furthering the possibility that Sondland either perjured himself or needed to clarify his original sworn statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Fadel |last=Allassan |date=November 16, 2019 |url=https://www.axios.com/david-holmes-confirms-trump-asked-sondland-ukraine-investigation-4c20f887-d79d-4bc4-8c73-d4fdc0dc91ce.html|title=State Department official confirms Trump asked Sondland about Ukraine investigation|website=Axios|access-date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, Holmes' statement provided the first characterization of the actual language and degree of Trump's interest in having Ukraine investigate the Bidens, with Sondland saying to Trump about Zelensky that "he loves your ass" and "will do anything you ask him to", and Sondland later telling Holmes that President Trump "doesn't give a shit about Ukraine" and "only cares about the big stuff"—namely, investigations into the Bidens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-holmes-statement-impeachment-inquiry-full-opening-statement/ |date=November 12, 2019 |title=Read David Holmes' full opening statement in impeachment inquiry|website=CBS News|language=en-US|access-date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/-it-s-a-bombshell-shakedown-witness-confirms-damning-impeachment-call-73563205693|title='It's a bombshell': Shakedown witness confirms damning impeachment call|website=MSNBC|language=en|access-date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani lobbied the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs|assistant secretary for consular affairs]], conceding the true purpose of Shokin's planned visit to the U.S. The State Department meanwhile remained silent while she faced public attacks in an attempt to recall her to the U.S.&lt;ref name="excerpts and analysis nov. 4" /&gt; Yovanovitch had been told by Sondland that showing support for the U.S. president may help prevent her dismissal but she chose not to heed the advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/04/takeaways-marie-yovanovitchs-an-michael-mckinleys-ukraine-testimony/ |title=7 takeaways from Marie Yovanovitch's and Michael McKinley's Ukraine testimony |last=Blake |first=Aaron |last2=Phillips |first2=Amber |date=November 4, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=November 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="excerpts and analysis nov. 4" /&gt;

McKinley, a former ambassador and later senior adviser to Secretary Pompeo, testified that he had three times advised the Secretary of State to defend Yovanovitch after the July 25 call in which Trump disparaged her became public knowledge. McKinley also said Kent was being pressured by State Department lawyers to remain silent and that Kent feared the State Department was relaying inaccurate information to Congress.&lt;ref name="excerpts and analysis nov. 4" /&gt; McKinley told the committees: "To see the emerging information on the engagement of our missions to procure negative political information for domestic purposes, combined with the failure I saw in the [State Department] to provide support for our professional cadre in a particularly trying time, I think the combination was a pretty good reason to decide enough, that I had no longer a useful role to play."&lt;ref name="first transcripts" /&gt;

The transcript of Ambassador Taylor's deposition was also released on November 6.

On October 25, 2019, Charles Kupperman, Trump's former deputy national security adviser, filed an advisory lawsuit, asking a D.C. federal judge to rule on whether he is lawfully obliged to comply with a subpoena he received from the House of Representatives. He said he will follow whatever the judge says.&lt;ref name="kupperman1" /&gt; He was scheduled to testify on October 28 but did not appear. On October 31, Judge [[Richard J.

Excerpts from the ruling include:

* "When DOJ insists that presidents can lawfully prevent their senior-level aides from responding to compelled congressional process and that neither the federal courts nor Congress has the power to do anything about it, DOJ promotes a conception of separation-of-powers principles that gets these constitutional commands exactly backwards. In reality, it is a core tenet of this Nation's founding that the powers of a monarch must be split between the branches of the government to prevent tyranny."&lt;ref name="McGahn appeal"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.axios.com/don-mcgahn-house-subpoena-ruling-trump-impeachment-dba4db98-6d91-4861-a6bc-2f7c66ba5ee5.html|title=McGahn appeals ruling ordering him to comply with House impeachment subpoena|website=Axios|language=en|access-date=December 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "To be sure, there may well be circumstances in which certain aides of the President possess confidential, classified, or privileged information that cannot be divulged in the national interest and that such aides may be bound by statute or executive order to protect.

House Democrats have requested the records from the grand jury proceedings that were part of the [[Mueller investigation]], stating that the material was needed to investigate whether or not articles of impeachment should include perjury charges against the president based on his responses to the Mueller probe. The district court decided in their favor, but two of the three judges on an appeals court panel seemed skeptical. They set oral arguments for January 3, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/18/court-mueller-russia-probe-071351|title=Judges suggest court shouldn't solve dispute over Mueller's evidence|last=Samuelsohn|first=Darren|last2=Gerstein|first2=Josh|date=November 18, 2019|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, 2020 the panel ruled 2-1 in favor of releasing the material to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/politics/house-mueller-secret-grand-jury/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2019, Chairman [[Adam Schiff]] announced that the first public hearings of the impeachment inquiry would be held on November 13, beginning with Bill Taylor and George Kent.&lt;ref name=beginning&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-department-official-to-testify-in-impeachment-probe-11573038000 |title=First Public Hearings in Impeachment Inquiry to Begin Next Week |last=Volz |first=Dustin |last2=Andrews |first2=Natalie |date=November 6, 2019 |website=The Wall Street Journal |language=en-US |access-date=November 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement added that [[Marie Yovanovitch]] would testify in the second public hearing on November 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/06/house-democrats-will-hold-first-public-impeachment-hearings-next-week-000319 |title=First public impeachment hearings will take place next week |last=Desiderio |first=Andrew |last2=Cheney |first2=Kyle |date=November 6, 2019 |website=Politico |language=en-US |access-date=November 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House appointed new aides, including [[Pam Bondi]] and [[Tony Sayegh]], to work on communications during the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-expected-to-bolster-impeachment-strategy-with-two-new-hires-11573068363 |title=White House Expected to Bolster Impeachment Strategy With Two New Hires |last=Bender |first=Michael C. |date=November 6, 2019 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=November 6, 2019 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; House Republicans assigned Representative [[Jim Jordan (American politician)|Jim Jordan]] (R-Ohio) to the House Intelligence Committee to participate in the hearings. Jordan replaced Representative [[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]] (R-Arkansas), who stepped down so Jordan could take his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/08/jim-jordan-intelligence-committee-068049|title=Jim Jordan joins Intelligence Committee to boost Trump in public impeachment hearings|last=Zanona|first=Melanie|date=November 8, 2019|website=Politico|language=en-US|access-date=November 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the House of Representatives resolution adopted in October 2019, Republican representatives can subpoena witnesses only with the concurrence of the Democratic committee chairman or with approval of the majority members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brune |first1=Tom |title=Nixon, Clinton, Trump: How the impeachment resolutions compare |url=https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/impeachment-resolutions-trump-nixon-clinton-1.38384184 |accessdate=November 11, 2019 |work=Newsday |date=November 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House Intelligence Committee ranking member, Representative [[Devin Nunes]] (R-California), in a November{{nbsp}}9 letter, provided a list of eight witnesses from whom the minority party wished to hear, including Hunter Biden. In Schiff's decline of the request to hear from Biden, he said he would not allow Republicans to use the hearings to conduct "sham investigations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/09/us/politics/republican-strategy-impeachment-trump.html|title=Republicans Argue Impeachment Case Falls Short of Proving Trump Misconduct|first1=Michael D.|last1=Shear|first2=Nicholas|last2=Fandos|date=November 9, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff also rejected Nunes's request to question the anonymous whistleblower, for the individual's safety and because subsequent evidence "not only confirms but far exceeds" the whistleblower's complaint, so "the whistleblower's testimony is therefore redundant and unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 10, 2019 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/politics/adam-schiff-whistleblower-impeachment-inquiry/index.html|title=Schiff says whistleblower testimony is 'redundant and unnecessary'|first=Manu|last=Raju|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As public hearings approached, a staff memo to Republican members of the three relevant committees outlined the major themes they should pursue in Trump's defense. This includes focusing on the July 25 call summary which they allege "shows no conditionality or evidence of pressure" and that both Presidents Trump and Zelensky have said there was no pressure. The memo contended that any concerns Zelensky may have had about negative consequences of publicly acknowledging he felt pressure from Trump were unwarranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/12/20961073/trump-impeachment-hearings-republican-testimony-strategy|title=A Republican memo details the party's impeachment inquiry defenses. They aren't very strong.|first=Sean|last=Collins|date=November 12, 2019|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo also claims that the "Ukrainian government was not aware of a hold on U.S. security assistance" before the July 25 call. It also points out that "President Trump met with President Zelensky and U.S. security assistance flowed to Ukraine in September 2019—both of which occurred without Ukraine investigating President Trump's political rivals."&lt;ref name="GOP defense memo"&gt;{{cite web |date=November 12, 2019 |first=Zachary |last=Basu |first2=Jonathan |last2=Swan |url=https://www.axios.com/republicans-impeachment-defense-memo-b4f6eeeb-6dab-49ed-a8d2-48eb736cfd8f.html|title=Ahead of public hearings, GOP outlines theory of impeachment defense in memo to members|website=Axios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the Ukraine aid came two days after the House Intelligence Committee was notified of the whistleblower complaint and opened an investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/trump-ukraine-timeline.html|title=Key Dates at the Center of the Ukraine Matter|first1=Sharon|last1=LaFraniere|first2=Andrew E.|last2=Kramer|first3=Danny|last3=Hakim|date=November 11, 2019|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two days after three House committees publicly announced an investigation into Giuliani's activities in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 9, 2019 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/09/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-investigation-1486753 |title=House panels launch investigation into Giuliani's dealings with Ukraine|first=Caitlin|last=Oprysko|website=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As hearings began, Schiff said Trump may have committed bribery, and House Speaker Pelosi joined him on November 14; bribery is specifically listed as an impeachable offense in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Budryk /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Caleb |last=Ecarma |url=https://www.mediaite.com/tv/how-did-democrats-decide-on-bribery-as-trumps-impeachable-offense/|title=How Did Democrats Decide on 'Bribery' as Trump's Offense?|date=November 22, 2019|website=Mediaite|language=en|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== November 13, 2019: Kent and Taylor ===

With live coverage on television, public hearings began at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] on November 13, 2019, in which [[George P. Kent|George Kent]] and [[William B. Taylor Jr.|William Taylor]] testified before the House Intelligence Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-hearings-live-updates/2019/11/13/e974f486-057b-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html|title=Live updates: Trump asked E.U. ambassador about status of Ukrainian 'investigations', diplomat reveals in new testimony|last=Wagner|first=John|last2=Sonmez|first2=Felicia|date=November 13, 2019|website=The Washington Post|access-date=November 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After opening statements from Chairman Schiff and ranking member Representative [[Devin Nunes|Nunes]], Taylor and Kent read their openings statements. This was followed by questions from the Chairman and the majority counsel, [[Daniel S. Goldman]], and then by the Ranking Member and the minority counsel, [[Steve Castor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/politics/who-are-dan-goldman-steve-castor-impeachment-lawyers/index.html|title=Staff lawyers to take star role in first hearings on impeachment|last=Rogers|first=Alex|date=November 13, 2019|website=CNN|access-date=November 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor testified that the day after the Trump–Zelensky phone call, one of his aides, David Holmes, overheard Sondland speaking to Trump via cellphone in a [[Kyiv]] restaurant, hearing the president refer to "the investigations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-hearings-begin-with-revelation-of-phone-call-implicating-trump-in-ukraine-scandal/2019/11/13/de8d21b8-063b-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html |date=November 13, 2019 |title=Impeachment hearings begin with new evidence of phone call implicating Trump in Ukraine controversy|first1=Karoun|last1=Demirjian|website=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another diplomat, Suriya Jayanti, also overheard the call. Holmes testified behind closed doors on November 15 that he heard Trump ask, "so, he's gonna do the investigation?" to which Sondland replied, "he's gonna do it", adding that Zelensky would do "anything you ask him to". Holmes also testified that Sondland later told him that Trump "did not give a shit about Ukraine" and "only cared about the big stuff{{nbsp}}... that benefits the president like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Veronica |last=Rocha |first2=Meg |last2=Wagner |url=https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-15-19/index.html|title=Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine testifies: Live updates|date=November 15, 2019|website=CNN|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts noted that the Sondland call itself constituted a major security breach, as it could have been intercepted by foreign intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ambassadors-cellphone-call-to-trump-from-kyiv-restaurant-was-a-stunning-breach-of-security-former-officials-say/2019/11/13/37d75752-0641-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html|title=Ambassador's cellphone call to Trump from Kyiv restaurant was a stunning breach of security, former officials say|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|date=November 13, 2019|website=The Washington Post|access-date=November 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data from [[Nielsen Corporation|Nielsen]], the first day of hearings had 13,098,000 viewers tuning in on various cable and broadcast channels (not including PBS, {{nowrap|C-SPAN}}, and online streaming).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Patten |first=Dominic |url=https://deadline.com/2019/11/impeachment-hearings-tv-ratings-donald-trump-fox-news-cnn-msnbc-1202786141/ |title=Impeachment Hearings Debut With 13M Viewers; Fox News Tops Cable &amp; Broadcast |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=November 14, 2019 |accessdate=November 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== November 15, 2019: Yovanovitch ===

[[Marie Yovanovitch]]'s testimony began at 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST and lasted six hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-yovanovitch-testimony-updates-2019-11|title=Marie Yovanovitch took aim at Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and top brass at the State Department in damning testimony|first1=Sonam|last1=Sheth |first2=Eliza|last2=Relman|date=Nov 15, 2019|accessdate=Nov 16, 2019|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; She directly contradicted the Republican theory that Ukraine had tried to undermine Trump in the 2016 elections. She said she had three contacts with Giuliani, not involving the current allegations, and did not know why he chose to attack and discredit her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-testimony-ukraine-ambassador-marie-yovanovitch/story?id=67044743|title=5 key takeaways from testimony by former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch|last=Flaherty|first=Anne|date=November 15, 2019|work=ABC News|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said his allegations against her were false and that no one in the State Department believed them. She added that she was "shocked and devastated" when Trump disparaged her and said she was "going to go through some things" during his telephone call with Zelensky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/politics/public-impeachment-hearings-day-2/index.html|title=Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine tells impeachment inquiry she was 'shocked and devastated' after being removed from her post|last1=Herb|first1=Jeremy|last2=Raju|first2=Manu|date=November 15, 2019|work=CNN|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her testimony, Trump berated her on Twitter, questioning her competence and saying the Ukrainian president had spoken unfavourably about her.&lt;ref name="BBC Yovanovitch"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50428537|title=How a Trump tweet shook impeachment hearing|first=Anthony|last=Zurcher|date=November 15, 2019|accessdate=November 16, 2019|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman Schiff informed Yovanovitch of the tweet during the hearing; she said it was "very intimidating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50436521|title=Trump impeachment inquiry: Envoy 'intimidated' by tweets during testimony|date=November 15, 2019|work=BBC News|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's behavior was labelled as [[witness intimidation]] by Democrats.&lt;ref name="BBC Yovanovitch" /&gt; [[Eric Swalwell]], who participated in questioning Yovanovitch during the hearing, said this could be laid out as a separate article of impeachment: "it's evidence of more obstruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/trump-attacks-impeachment-witness-on-twitter-democrats-see-intimidation-idUSKBN1XP155 |title=Trump attacks impeachment witness on Twitter, Democrats see intimidation |work=Reuters |first=Susan |last=Cornwell |first2=Richard |last2=Cowan |first3=Patricia |last3=Zengerle |date=November 15, 2019|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In questioning Vindman, Devin Nunes repeatedly demanded that he name all individuals to whom he had spoken.

The report's preface states:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.

The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.

At the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for "a favor though": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts.&lt;ref name="Intel-Report" /&gt;{{Rp|8–9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Republicans of the House Committees had released a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence does not support accusations. "The evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor," said the draft report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/02/house-gop-draft-report-defends-president-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2590245001/ |newspaper=USA Today |first=Bart |last=Jansen |first2=Christal |last2=Hayes |title=House GOP report on impeachment inquiry defends Trump's dealings with Ukraine |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/12/02/784183484/read-republican-report-on-the-impeachment-inquiry |title=READ: Republican Report On The Impeachment Inquiry |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report also painted the push to impeachment as solely politically motivated. Its executive summary states that "The Democrats are trying to impeach a duly elected president based on the accusations and assumptions of unelected bureaucrats who disagreed with President Trump's policy initiatives and processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Taylor |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/12/02/784260364/house-gop-rebuts-democrats-impeachment-efforts-no-bribery-extortion-proven |title=House GOP Rebuts Democrats' Impeachment Efforts: No 'Bribery, Extortion' Proven |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This report concluded the inquiry stage of the impeachment process and the house then voted on the approved articles of impeachment; [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|Trump was impeached]] on December 18, 2019.

On September 30, CNN, citing an analysis by Laura Edelson at [[New York University]]'s [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Tandon School of Engineering]], reported that Trump and his reelection campaign had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Facebook advertisements to push for his defense. More than 1,800 ads on Trump's Facebook page that mentioned "impeachment" had run the week prior and had been viewed between 16 and 18 million times on Facebook. The analysis indicates the campaign spent between $600,000 and $2&amp;nbsp;million on the ads, which reportedly attempted to rally and enlist people for the "Official Impeachment Defense Task Force". A further $700,000 is believed to have been spent for ads on Pence's Facebook page, which mirrored the content on Trump's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/politics/facebook-trump-impeachment/index.html |title=Trump is using Facebook to run thousands of ads about impeachment |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Donie |last2=Wright |first2=David |date=September 30, 2019 |website=CNN |access-date=October 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House officially responded to the impeachment proceedings in a letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone to House Speaker Pelosi that it would cease all cooperation with the investigation due to a litany of concerns, including that there had been no vote of the full House, and the secrecy of the proceedings. In the October{{nbsp}}8 letter, the White House officially declined to cooperate with what they claimed was an illegitimate effort "to overturn the results of the 2016 election". The eight-page letter said the investigation "violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent". Pelosi responded to the letter: "The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction."&lt;ref name="bbc Oct 9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-10-08/read-white-house-letter-declares-impeachment-inquiry-unconstitutional |title=READ: White House Letter Declares Impeachment Inquiry Unconstitutional |last1=Hagen |first1=Lisa |date=October 8, 2019 |work=US News and World Report |accessdate=October 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="borger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blake-aaron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Oct 8 2019" /&gt;

During an October 17 press conference, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he "was involved with the process" of the freezing of military aid. Mulvaney gave his account of why Trump decided to hold back military aid to Ukraine. One, Trump felt the other European countries were not doing enough. Two, Trump felt Ukraine was a "corrupt place" which included having "corruption related to the DNC server" concerning "what happened in 2016". As a result, reporter [[Jonathan Karl]] told Mulvaney "what you just described is a ''quid pro quo''. It is: 'Funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.'" Mulvaney replied to Karl: "We do that all the time with foreign policy{{nbsp}}... Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy." Later in the press conference, Mulvaney quoted a third reason on why military aid was frozen: they had yet to cooperate with a U.S. Justice Department investigation into alleged Ukrainian interference in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref name="becket" /&gt;&lt;ref name="getoverit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mulvaney-acknowledges-trump-held-ukraine-aid-political-reasons-get-over-n1068256 |title=Mulvaney acknowledges Trump held up Ukraine aid for political reasons: 'Get over it' |last=Smith |first=Allan |date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20191024095917/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mulvaney-acknowledges-trump-held-ukraine-aid-political-reasons-get-over-n1068256 |archive-date=October 24, 2019 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=November 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whistleblowers and their lawyers ===

[[Andrew P. Bakaj]], the lead attorney representing the whistleblowers, sent a joint letter to Maguire on September 28, made public on September 29, in which they raised concerns about the language used by Trump, amongst other things. In the letter, the lawyers state "The events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client's identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm's way." The letter also mentioned the $50,000 "bounty" that two conservative Trump supporters have offered as a reward for information about the whistleblower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49881847 |title=Trump is endangering whistleblower, lawyers warn |date=September 30, 2019 |work=BBC News|access-date=September 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Zaid]], co-counsel for the whistleblower, said in a statement in September 2019 that whistleblowers' identities are protected by law and cited testimony by Maguire which drew upon the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]]. The statement was released after Trump questioned on Twitter the validity of the whistleblower's statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/463687-trump-white-house-trying-to-find-out-whistleblowers-identity |title=Trump: White House 'trying to find out' whistleblower's identity |last=Lejeune |first=Tristan |date=September 30, 2019 |website=The Hill|access-date=September 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakaj took to Twitter to issue a warning on September 30 that the whistleblower is entitled to anonymity, is protected by laws and policies, and is not to be retaliated against; to do so would violate federal law.&lt;ref name="the Hill retaliation" /&gt; Bakaj argued in an October 25 ''[[Washington Post]]'' op-ed that the identity of his client is no longer pertinent after further events corroborated his client's account of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/we-represent-the-whistleblower-their-identity-is-no-longer-relevant/2019/10/25/d2ff25a2-f6a1-11e9-8cf0-4cc99f74d127_story.html |date=October 25, 2019 |title=We represent the whistleblower.

On November 7, Bakaj sent a letter to the White House warning Trump to "cease and desist" calling for the public disclosure of the whistleblower's identity and "engaging in rhetoric and activity that places [the whistleblower] and their family in physical danger". The lawyer said the president would be legally and morally liable if anyone were to be "physically harmed as a result of his, or his surrogates', behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/politics/ukraine-whistleblower-trump-cease-and-desist/index.html|title=Lawyer for Ukraine whistleblower sends White House cease and desist letter to stop Trump's attacks|last=LeBlanc|first=Paul|date=November 7, 2019|work=CNN|accessdate=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Unlike in past impeachment proceedings in which Congress had the benefit of an investigation conducted in secret by an independent prosecutor, we must conduct the initial investigation ourselves," Schiff said. "This is the case because the Department of Justice under Bill Barr expressly declined to investigate this matter after a criminal referral had been made."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/25/trump-impeachment-inquiry-why-didnt-doj-look-harder-ukraine-call/4024155002/ |title=As Trump impeachment probe heats up, some say Congress is doing inquiry the Justice Department should've done |last=Johnson |first=Kevin |date=October 25, 2019 |work=USA Today |accessdate=October 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians and diplomats have called the severity of the allegations "unprecedented" in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-behavior-with-ukraine-stupid-and-unprecedented-historian-2019-9 |title=Trump's actions with Ukraine were 'profoundly stupid' and beyond anything any president has ever done, historians and veteran diplomats say |last=Haltiwanger |first=John |website=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=September 29, 2019 |date=September 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaine Kamarck has described how this inquiry is different from Nixon's Watergate: "the president himself is directly involved in all four of the likely articles of impeachment": obstruction of justice, violation of federal election law (a possible constitutional abuse of power), obstruction of Congress, and violation of the emoluments clause.&lt;ref name="Kamarck_10/18/2019"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/10/18/all-roads-lead-to-putin-this-week-in-impeachment/|title=All roads lead to Putin: This week in impeachment|last=Kamarck|first=Elaine|date=October 18, 2019|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|access-date=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics responded to tweets by Trump in which he quoted [[Robert Jeffress]], a prominent Southern Baptist pastor who warned of a "Civil War-like fracture" if Democrats continued the inquiry. On Twitter, [[Harvard Law School]] professor John Coates cautioned that the tweet was an independent basis for impeachment as the sitting president was threatening civil war if Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power.&lt;ref name="civil war quote"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/trump-civil-war-tweet-grounds-impeachment-1462044 |title=Trump's 'Civil War' Quote Tweet Is Actually Grounds for Impeachment, Says Harvard Law Professor |last=Hutzler |first=Alexandra |date=September 30, 2019 |website=[[Newsweek]] |access-date=October 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fellow faculty member of Harvard Law, [[Laurence Tribe]], agreed but cautioned that, due to the typical tone of Trump's tweets, the statement could be interpreted as "typical Trumpian [[bloviating]]" that would not be taken seriously or literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-coates-donald-trump-civil-war-tweet-impeachment_n_5d926a6ae4b0019647ad2dc7 |title=Trump's 'Civil War' Tweet May Be Grounds For Impeachment: Harvard Law Professor |last=Moye |first=David |date=September 30, 2019 |website=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=October 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''USA Today''{{'}}s Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolf published an overview of the opinions of various legal experts, including law professors. The University of Texas's [[Sanford Levinson]] says "nobody really knows" how to define the "[[High crimes and misdemeanors#United States|high crimes and misdemeanors]]" of the Constitution's impeachment clause. According to Georgetown University's [[Randy Barnett]], "The Constitution gets violated all the time. That doesn't make the violation of the Constitution a high crime or misdemeanor." Barnett further states that Trump's accusers "have been alleging impeachable offenses since before [he] took the oath of office". The University of Southern California's [[Orin Kerr]] says, "It's about abusing the office, not about violating a technical provision of a particular clause," and {{nowrap|"[Trump}} is] taking care of himself, not taking care of the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wolf |first1=Richard |title=Article II of the Constitution: Trump's 'right to do whatever I want?'

In December 2019, ''[[Christianity Today]]'' published an editorial ("Trump Should Be Removed from Office") calling for Trump's removal from office, asserting among other criticisms that he "attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president's political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december-web-only/trump-should-be-removed-from-office.html|title=Trump Should Be Removed from Office|first=Mark|last=Galli|authorlink = Mark Galli|website=ChristianityToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinion ==

An analysis of polls showed that support for impeachment among the public grew after the Trump–Ukraine scandal first became public knowledge in September 2019, but through mid-December, Americans remained sharply divided on whether Trump should be removed from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-americans-support-impeaching-president-trump/ |title=Do Americans Support Impeaching Trump? |last=Bycoffe |first=Aaron |date=December 17, 2019 |website=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=December 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll conducted by ''[[The Economist]]'' and YouGov from October 16, 2019, stated that under half of their polled adults supported impeachment, and most of those respondents also support removal from office. Besides, it noted that a significant proportion of Americans (70% of Republicans, 38% of independents, and 13% of Democrats) believe a [[Deep state in the United States|deep state]] is trying to obstruct or unseat President Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/10/16/americans-favor-impeachment-want-trump-removed |title=Americans who favor impeachment want President Trump removed, too |work=[[YouGov]] |access-date=October 19, 2019 |first=Kathy |last=Frankovic |date=October 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; An October 17 poll from the Pew Research Center of 3,487 adults found that 54% were in favor of impeachment and 44% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.people-press.org/2019/10/17/modest-changes-in-views-of-impeachment-proceedings-since-early-september/ |title=Modest Changes in Views of Impeachment Proceedings Since Early September |date=October 17, 2019 |website=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press| access-date=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP''''', No. 19-715, is a pending [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case involving the [[tax returns of Donald Trump|tax returns of President Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="SCOTUSdocket"&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-715.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{see|List of lawsuits involving Donald Trump}}

The House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed numerous records from the President's accounting firm, Mazars, Deutsche Bank and other companies. The President sued, and the subpoena was blocked while the case wound its way through the courts, losing in district court and on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/supreme-court-temporarily-halts-court-order-requiring-accountants-to-turn-over-trumps-tax-returns-to-congress.html|title=Supreme Court temporarily halts court order requiring accountants to turn over Trump's tax returns to Congress|first=Tucker Higgins,Jacob|last=Pramuk|date=November 18, 2019|website=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court agreed to continue the block for a few days, ordering the House Counsel to submit a rebuttal by November 21, which it did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-11-21/house-attorneys-say-trumps-tax-returns-needed-for-impeachment-inquiry|title=House attorneys say Trump's tax returns are needed for impeachment inquiry|date=November 22, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seeking a rapid subpoena ruling, House general counsel [[Douglas Letter]] wrote, "The president certainly has no right to dictate the timetable by which third parties provide information that could potentially be relevant to that inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/21/democrats-seek-quick-subpoena-ruling-in-trump-tax-records-case/|newspaper=Roll Call|date=November 21, 2019|author=Todd Ruger|title=Democrats seek quick subpoena ruling in Trump tax records case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The target of the subpoena (Mazars) has said that it is willing to comply with the subpoena; Trump's lawsuit against Mazars, brought in his personal capacity, has delayed Mazars' response.&lt;ref name=Lederman&gt;{{cite web|author=Marty Lederman|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/67461/understanding-the-two-mazars-subpoena-cases-before-the-supreme-court/|title=Understanding the Two Mazars Subpoena Cases Before the Supreme Court|date=November 25, 2019|website=Just Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar [[Marty Lederman]] has described the ''Mazars'' case as more important than the ''Trump v. Vance'' case.&lt;ref name=Lederman/&gt; Lederman describes Trump's argument&amp;mdash;that Congress entirely lacks "constitutional authority to investigate a sitting President's possible conflicts of interest and violations of law"&amp;mdash;as an "alarming" assertion that, "would, if credited, be a radical departure from our constitutional history and tradition."&lt;ref name=Lederman/&gt;

==D.C. Circuit==
===Ruling===
Circuit Judge [[David S. Tatel]] wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Circuit Judge [[Patricia Millett]].&lt;ref name="circuitopinions"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Trump v. Comm. on Oversight &amp; Reform |vol=940 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=710 |pinpoint= |court=[[D.C. Cir.]] |date=2019 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20191011141 |accessdate=2019-12-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
Circuit Judge [[Neomi Rao]] dissented, insisting that the impeachment power is the only legitimate method for such congressional investigations.&lt;ref name="circuitopinions"/&gt;

===''En banc'' rehearing denied===
On November 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit denied the Trump administration's petition for an ''[[en banc]]'' rehearing. [[Gregory Katsas]], [[Neomi Rao]], and [[Karen Henderson]] dissented from the denial of rehearing.&lt;ref name="noenbanc"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Trump v. Comm. on Oversight &amp; Reform |vol= |reporter=No. |opinion=19-5142 |pinpoint= |court=D.C.

==Supreme Court==
The question facing the Supreme Court is whether the U.S. House of Representatives has the authority to issue subpoenas to obtain the private financial records of the president and his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP|url=https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-mazars/|website=SCOTUSblog|language=en|access-date=2020-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2019, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted a stay of the D.C. Circuit's ruling extending the time for the appealing party (Trump) to file a petition for a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'', asking the Court to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112519zr_7l48.pdf 19A545 TRUMP, DONALD J., ET AL. V. MAZARS USA, LLP, ET AL.] supremecourt.gov November 25, 2019&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's legal team filed the petition on December 5, 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/politics/trump-appeal-supreme-court-house-subpoena-mazars/index.html |title=Trump asks Supreme Court to block House subpoena for financial documents and take up case |author=Ariane de Vogue |date=December 5, 2019 |website=cnn.com |access-date=December 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 13, 2019, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the case with ''[[Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG]]''.&lt;ref name="SCOTUSdocket" /&gt;

Oral arguments was originally scheduled to take place on March 31, 2020, but two weeks before the arguments were to take place, the Supreme Court postponed arguments in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]] and waited one month to announce the rescheduled date. In April 2020, the Supreme Court said that oral argument in the ''Mazars'' case and other cases would be heard by telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/13/833292153/supreme-court-to-hear-arguments-by-telephone-including-on-trumps-financial-recor|title=Supreme Court To Hear Arguments By Telephone, Including On Trump's Financial Records|last=Totenberg|first=Nina|date=13 April 2020|website=NPR.org|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_04-13-20|title=Press Releases - April 13, 2020 - Supreme Court of the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=[[SupremeCourt.gov]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consolidated oral arguments for ''Trump v.

Congressional subpoenas related to this case will expire with the end of the 116th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Coronavirus May Keep Trump’s Financial Records Under Wraps Forever|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/trump-supreme-court-mazars-deutsche-bank-vance-delay.html|last=Stahl|first=Jeremy|date=2020-03-16|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump was born and raised in [[Queens]], a borough of New York City, and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from the [[Wharton School]]. He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it [[The Trump Organization]], and expanded its operations from Queens and [[Brooklyn]] into [[Manhattan]]. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started [[The Trump Organization#Other ventures and investments|various side ventures]], mostly by licensing his name. He bought the [[Miss Universe]] brand of [[beauty pageant]]s in 1996, and sold it in 2015. He produced and hosted ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', a [[reality television]] series, from 2003 to 2015. {{As of|2020}}, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated his net worth to be $2.1&amp;nbsp;billion.{{efn|name=Wealth}}&lt;!-- Updated annually per [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 5.

Trump entered the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential race]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and defeated 16 other candidates in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|primaries]]. [[Political positions of Donald Trump|His political positions]] have been described as [[populist]], [[protectionist]], and [[nationalist]]. He was elected in a surprise victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], but lost the popular vote.{{efn|name=electoral-college|Presidential elections in the United States are decided by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], in which each state names a number of electors equal to its representation in [[United States Congress|Congress]], and all delegates from each state usually vote for the winner of the local state vote (except for [[faithless electors]]). Consequently, it is possible for the [[president-elect]] to have received fewer votes from the country's total population (the popular vote). This situation has occurred [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|five times since 1824]].}} He became [[List of presidents of the United States by age|the oldest]] first-term [[U.S. president]],{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]] was older upon his second-term inauguration.}} and the first without [[List of presidents of the United States by previous experience|prior military or government service]].

Trump has advocated a stricter [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|immigration policy]]: he imposed [[Trump travel ban|travel bans]] on various countries, tightened enforcement of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|immigration law]], and increased [[Trump administration migrant detentions|migrant detentions]] and [[Trump administration family separation policy|family separations]]. He also vowed to "[[Trump wall|build the wall]]" on the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]] but has so far managed only to renovate [[Mexico–United States barrier|pre-existing fencing]]. He enacted [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|a tax-cut package]] for individuals and businesses, rescinding the [[individual shared responsibility provision|individual health insurance mandate]] penalty. He appointed [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an [[America First (policy)|America First]] agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] trade negotiations, the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change, and the [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]]. He [[Trump tariffs|imposed import tariffs]] which triggered [[China–United States trade war|a trade war with China]], [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War#Withdrawal from north Syria|withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria]]. Trump met three times with North Korea's leader [[Kim Jong-un]], but talks on [[denuclearization]] broke down in 2019.

A [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|special counsel investigation]] led by [[Robert Mueller]] found that Trump and [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|his campaign]] welcomed and encouraged [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election]] under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|criminal conspiracy]] or coordination{{efn|name=coordination|"In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign 'coordinat[ed]'{{snd}}a term that appears in the appointment order{{snd}}with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, 'coordination' does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement{{snd}}tacit or express{{snd}}between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." [https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report], vol. I, p. 2}} with Russia. Mueller also investigated Trump for [[obstruction of justice]], and [[Mueller Report|his report]] neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that offense. After Trump [[Trump–Ukraine scandal|solicited the investigation of a political rival by Ukraine]], the House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|impeached him]] in December 2019 for [[abuse of power]] and [[obstruction of Congress]]. [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|The Senate acquitted him]] of both charges in February 2020.

Trump began to purchase significant blocks of shares in various public companies, leading some observers to think he was engaged in the practice called [[greenmail]], or feigning the intent to acquire the companies and then pressuring management to repurchase the buyer's stake at a premium. ''The New York Times'' found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later "lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html |title=Decade in the Red: Trump Tax Figures Show Over $1 Billion in Business Losses |first1=Russ |last1=Buettner |first2=Susanne |last2=Craig |date=May 8, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/06/business/american-air-gets-trump-bid-of-7.5-billion.html |title=American Air Gets Trump Bid Of $7.5 Billion |first=Agis |last=Salpukas |date=October 6, 1989 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/nyregion/trump-ends-his-struggle-to-gain-control-of-bally.html |title=Trump Ends His Struggle to Gain Control of Bally |first=Donald |last=Janson |date=February 23, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump's first book, ''[[The Art of the Deal]]'' (1987), was on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for 48 weeks.

=== Political activities up to 2015 ===

[[File:Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.jpg|thumb|Trump and President [[Bill Clinton]] in June 2000]]

Trump's political party affiliation changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987, switched to the Reform Party in 1999, the Democratic Party in 2001, and back to the Republican Party in 2009.&lt;ref name="PolitiFact.24.Aug.15"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gillin |first=Joshua |title=Bush says Trump was a Democrat longer than a Republican 'in the last decade' |url=https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/aug/24/jeb-bush/bush-says-trump-was-democrat-longer-republican-las/ |accessdate=March 18, 2017 |website=[[PolitiFact]] |date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Donald Trump speaking at CPAC 2011 by Mark Taylor 2.jpg|thumb|Trump speaking at CPAC 2011]]

Trump speculated about running for president in [[2012 United States presidential election|the 2012 election]], making his first speaking appearance at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving speeches in early primary states.&lt;ref name="McA"&gt;{{cite news |last=MacAskill |first=Ewen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/16/donald-trump-us-presidential-race |title=Donald Trump bows out of 2012 US presidential election race |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 16, 2011 |access-date=February 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bobic |first1=Igor |last2=Stein |first2=Sam |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cpac_n_58adc0f4e4b03d80af7141cf |title=How CPAC Helped Launch Donald Trump's Political Career |work=[[HuffPost]] |date=February 22, 2017 |access-date=February 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 he announced he would not run.&lt;ref name="McA"/&gt;

Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/11/donald-trump-cpac-president-act_n_821923.html |title=Donald Trump Brings His 'Pretend To Run For President' Act To CPAC |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=April 21, 2011 |first=Jason |last=Linkins |date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 2016 election, ''The New York Times'' speculated that Trump "accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world" after Obama lampooned him at the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] Dinner in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 12, 2016 |first1=Maggie |last1=Haberman |author1link=Maggie Haberman |first2=Alexander |last2=Burns |author2link=Alex Burns (journalist) |title=Donald Trump's Presidential Run Began in an Effort to Gain Stature |accessdate=April 13, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the superintendent of the New York Military Academy at the time, Jeffrey Coverdale, ordered the headmaster of the school, Evan Jones, to give him Trump's academic records so he could keep them secret, according to Jones. Coverdale confirmed that he had been asked to hand the records over to members of the school's board of trustees who were Trump's friends, but he refused to and instead sealed them on campus. The incident reportedly happened days after Trump demanded the release of President Barack Obama's academic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 5, 2019 |last1=Fisher |first1=Marc |authorlink=Marc Fisher |title='Grab that record': How Trump's high school transcript was hidden |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/grab-that-record-how-trumps-high-school-transcript-was-hidden/2019/03/05/8815b7b8-3c61-11e9-aaae-69364b2ed137_story.html |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=June 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against [[Andrew Cuomo]].

According to Trump's attorney [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], in May 2015 he sent letters to the New York Military Academy and to Fordham, threatening legal action if the schools ever released Trump's grades or SAT scores; Fordham confirmed receipt of the letter as well as a phone call from a member of the Trump team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/2019/2/27/18243099/michael-cohen-trump-fordham-grades |title=Michael Cohen: I threatened Fordham to keep quiet about Trump's SAT scores and grades |last=Coaston |first=Jane |date=February 27, 2019 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the [[2016 United States presidential election|general election]]. Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016.

Clinton had established a significant lead over Trump in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016|national polls]] throughout most of 2016.

==== Campaign rhetoric ====

In his campaign, Trump said he disdained [[political correctness]]; he also said the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse [[media bias]].&lt;ref name=Walsh-160724&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth T. |last=Walsh |authorlink=Kenneth T.

In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from ''The New York Times''.

In December 2017, Trump signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, temporarily lowered personal tax brackets until 2025, increased child tax credit, doubled the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]] exemption to $11.2&amp;nbsp;million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/15/us/politics/final-republican-tax-bill-cuts.html |title=What's in the Final Republican Tax Bill |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first1=Wilson |last1=Andrews |first2=Alicia |last2=Parlapiano |date=December 15, 2017 |accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump is a skeptic of multilateral trade deals, as he believes they indirectly incentivize unfair trade practices that then tend to go unpoliced. He favors bilateral trade deals, as they allow one party to pull out if the other party is believed to be behaving unfairly. Trump favors neutral or positive balances of trade over negative balances of trade, also known as a "trade deficit". Trump adopted his current skeptical views toward trade liberalization in the 1980s, and he sharply criticized [[NAFTA]] during the Republican primary campaign in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schlesinger |first=Jacob M. |title=Trump Forged His Ideas on Trade in the 1980s – And Never Deviated |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-forged-his-ideas-on-trade-in-the-1980sand-never-deviated-1542304508 |date=November 15, 2018 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-lays-out-protectionist-views-in-trade-speech-1467145538 |title=Donald Trump Lays Out Protectionist Views in Trade Speech |last=Epstein |first=Reid J. |date=June 28, 2016 |last2=Nelson |first2=Colleen McCain |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] {{subscription required}} |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-calls-nafta-a-disaster/ |title=Trump calls NAFTA a "disaster" |date=September 25, 2015 |website=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew the U.S. from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/trump-tpp-things-to-know/index.html |title=Trump's TPP withdrawal: 5 things to know |last=Bradner |first=Eric |date=January 23, 2017 |website=[[CNN]] |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,&lt;ref name=Inman&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/10/war-over-steel-trump-tips-global-trade-turmoil-tariffs |title=The war over steel: Trump tips global trade into new turmoil |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 10, 2018 |accessdate=March 15, 2018 |last=Inman |first=Phillip}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched a [[China–United States trade war|trade war]] with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50&amp;nbsp;billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/donald-trump-says-he-favors-big-tariffs-on-chinese-exports/ |title=Donald Trump Says He Favors Big Tariffs on Chinese Exports |last=Haberman |first=Maggie |authorlink=Maggie Haberman |date=January 7, 2016 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-ministry/trump-sets-tariffs-on-50-billion-in-chinese-goods-beijing-strikes-back-idUSKBN1JB0KC |title=Trump sets tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods; Beijing strikes |date=June 16, 2018 |work=[[Reuters]] |first1=David |last1=Lawder |first2=Ben |last2=Blanchard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, Trump has said incorrectly that these import tariffs are paid by China into the [[U.S. Treasury]].&lt;ref name="Newburger-190512"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/12/kudlow-says-us-will-pay-for-china-tariffs-contradicting-trump.html |title=Kudlow acknowledges US will pay for China tariffs, contradicting Trump |website=[[CNBC]] |date=May 12, 2019 |accessdate=May 20, 2019 |first=Emma |last=Newburger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump as president has approved large increases in government spending, as well as the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the American government's budget deficit has increased by almost 50%, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Long |first1=Heather |last2=Stein |first2=Jeff |title=The U.S. deficit hit $984 billion in 2019, soaring during Trump era |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/25/us-deficit-hit-billion-marking-nearly-percent-increase-during-trump-era/ |accessdate=June 10, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2020, the official unemployment rate shot up to 14.7% due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trump has rolled back federal regulations aimed at curbing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, air pollution, water pollution, and the usage of toxic substances. One example is the [[Clean Power Plan]]. He relaxed environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, while expanding permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing [[Arctic Refuge drilling controversy|drilling in the Arctic Refuge]].

==== Government size and deregulation ====

Trump's early policies have favored [[deregulation|rollback and dismantling of government regulations]]. He has signed 15 [[Congressional Review Act]] disapproval resolutions to allow Congress to repeal executive regulations, the second President to sign any such resolutions after the first CRA resolution was passed in 2001, and the first President to sign more than one such resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Adriance |first=Sam |title=President Trump Signs First Congressional Review Act Disapproval Resolution in 16 Years |url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/president-trump-signs-first-congressional-review-act-disapproval-resolution-16-years |date=February 16, 2017 |magazine=[[The National Law Review]] |accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended or reversed ninety federal regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Farand |first=Chloe |title=Donald Trump Disassembles 90 Federal State Regulations in Just Over a Month in White House |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-federal-state-regulations-month-oval-office-white-house-us-president-deregulate-a7614031.html |date=March 6, 2017 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump-Era Trend: Industries Protest.

On February 15, 2019, after Trump received from Congress only $1.375&amp;nbsp;billion for border fencing after demanding $5.7&amp;nbsp;billion for the Trump wall, Trump declared a [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States]], in the hopes of getting another $6.7&amp;nbsp;billion of funds for the Trump wall without congressional approval, using funds for military construction, [[drug interdiction]], and money from the Treasury.&lt;ref name=Wilkie/&gt; In doing so, Trump acknowledged that he "didn't need to" declare a national emergency, but he "would rather do it much faster".&lt;ref name=Wilkie/&gt;

=== Social media ===

{{Main|Donald Trump on social media}}

Trump's presence on social media has attracted attention worldwide since he joined [[Twitter]] in March 2009. He communicated heavily on Twitter during the 2016 election campaign, and has continued to use this channel during his presidency. The attention on Trump's Twitter activity has significantly increased since he was sworn in as president. As of May 2019, he is in the top 15 for most Twitter followers at more than 60&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Twitter: Most Followers |url=https://friendorfollow.com/twitter/most-followers/ |accessdate=May 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of May 2020, Trump had written about 52,000 tweets.&lt;ref name="BBCTweets"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52815552 |title=Twitter tags Trump tweet with fact-checking warning |date=27 May 2020 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=14 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counted through the Trump Twitter Archive, these include 22,115 tweets over seven years before his presidential candidacy, 8,159 tweets during the {{frac|1|1|2}} years of his candidacy and transition period, and 14,186 tweets over the first three years of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive |title=Search |website=Trump Twitter Archive |access-date=2020-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has frequently used Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public, sidelining the press.&lt;ref name="federalist-sidelining"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/23/donald-trumps-social-media-use-key-sidelining-press-2/ |title=Donald Trump's Social Media Use Is Key To Sidelining The Press |first=Dustin |last=Steeve |date=January 23, 2017 |work=[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]] |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since early in his presidency, his tweets have been considered official statements by the [[president of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/trump-tweets-official-statements/index.html |title=Spicer: Tweets are Trump's official statements |first=Elizabeth |last=Landers |date=June 6, 2017 |work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; employed for announcing policy or personnel changes.

On December 3, 2019, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] published a report authored by Democrats on the committee, stating that "the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection." The report said Trump withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political rivals. Furthermore, the report described Trump was the only U.S. president thus far to have "openly and indiscriminately" defied impeachment proceedings by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mascaro |first1=Lisa |last2=Jalonick |first2=Mary Clare |first3=Zeke |last3=Miller |first4=Colleen |last4=Long |first5=Eric |last5=Tucker |first6=Jill |last6=Colvin |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=House Releases 300-Page Report Outlining Evidence for Trump's Impeachment |url=https://time.com/5743345/house-releases-trump-impeachment-report/ |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weiland |first1=Noah |title=Impeachment Briefing: The Democratic Report |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/impeachment-briefing-the-democratic-report.html |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intel-Report"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_trump-ukraine_impeachment_inquiry_report.pdf |title=Report of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Pursuant to H.

'''''Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG''''', No. 19-760, is a pending [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case involving the [[tax returns of Donald Trump|tax returns of President Donald Trump]].

===Ruling===


===Concurrence/dissent===

==Supreme Court==
The question facing the Supreme Court is whether the U.S. House of Representatives has the authority to issue subpoenas to obtain the private financial records of the president and his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Trump v.

On December 13, 2019, the Supreme Court consolidated the case with ''[[Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP|Trump v. Mazars]]''.&lt;ref name="SCOTUSdocket"&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-715.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral arguments were originally scheduled to take place on March 31, 2020, but two weeks before the arguments were to take place, the Supreme Court postponed arguments in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]] and waited one month to announce the rescheduled date. In April 2020, the Supreme Court said that oral argument in the ''Mazars'' case and other cases would be heard by telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Supreme Court To Hear Arguments By Telephone, Including On Trump's Financial Records|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/13/833292153/supreme-court-to-hear-arguments-by-telephone-including-on-trumps-financial-recor|last=Totenberg|first=Nina|date=13 April 2020|website=NPR.org|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Press Releases - April 13, 2020 - Supreme Court of the United States|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_04-13-20|last=|first=|date=|website=[[SupremeCourt.gov]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oral arguments for the consolidated ''Trump v.

      <text bytes="5743" xml:space="preserve">'''Reality distortion field''' (or RDF) is a term first used by [[Bud Tribble]] at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in 1981, to describe company co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]' [[charisma]] and its effects on the developers working on the [[Macintosh]] project.&lt;ref name=Hertzfeld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Reality_Distortion_Field.txt |title=Reality Distortion Field |first=Andy |last=Hertzfeld |publisher=Folklore.org |date=February 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribble said that the term came from ''[[Star Trek]]'',&lt;ref name=Hertzfeld /&gt; where in [[The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series)|the Menagerie]] episode, it was used to describe how the aliens created their own new world through mental force.  

==Steve Jobs==
In Chapter Three of ''[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]'', biographer [[Walter Isaacson]] states that around 1972, while Jobs was attending [[Reed College]], [[Robert Friedland]] "taught Steve the reality distortion field." The RDF was said by [[Andy Hertzfeld]] to be Steve Jobs' ability to convince himself, and others around him, to believe almost anything with a mix of charm, charisma, [[bravery|bravado]], [[hyperbole]], [[marketing]], appeasement and persistence. It was said to distort his co-workers' sense of proportion and scales of difficulties and to make them believe that whatever impossible task he had at hand was possible. Jobs could also use the reality distortion field to appropriate others' ideas as his own, sometimes proposing an idea back to its originator, only a week after dismissing it.&lt;ref name=Hertzfeld /&gt;

The term has been used to refer to Jobs' keynote speeches ("[[Stevenote]]s") by observers and devoted users of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Apple Macintosh|computers]] and products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativepro.com/notes-epicenter-exploring-reality-distortion-field/|title=Notes from the Epicenter: Exploring the Reality Distortion Field|last=Dudrow|first=Andrea|date=October 16, 2000|website=|publisher=CreativePro|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and derisively by Apple's competitors in [[Criticism of Apple Inc.|criticisms of Apple]]. On [[Research In Motion]]'s official [[BlackBerry]] [[blog]], [[Jim Balsillie]] introduced a blog post by saying "For those of us who live outside of Apple's distortion field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.blackberry.com/2010/10/rim-responds-to-apples-distortion-field/ |title=RIM Responds to Apple's ‘Distortion Field' |publisher=Inside BlackBerry |date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other instances==
The term has been extended, with a mixture of awe and scorn, to other managers and leaders in industry who try to convince their employees to become passionately committed to projects without regard to their overall difficulty or to competitive forces in the market. It is sometimes used with regard to excessively-hyped products that are not necessarily connected with any one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidtemkin.com/mtarchive/000012.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618065115/http://www.davidtemkin.com/mtarchive/000012.html |archivedate=June 18, 2010 |title=The Ajax Reality Distortion Field |publisher=davidtemkin.com |date=April 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The term has been also associated with [[Donald Trump]]'s approach to running his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 campaign for United States President]] and his [[Presidency of Donald Trump|presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-16/peeking-inside-trump-s-smoke-and-mirrors-tour|title=A Peek Inside Trump's Smoke and Mirrors Tour|last=O'Brien|first=Timothy L.|date=2016-06-16|website=Bloomberg View|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, 4 January 2020 American President [[Donald Trump]] said if Iran retaliate for assassination of General [[Qasem Soleimani]], "the United States will hit 52 Iranian sites, some at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture, very fast and very hard." The threat was widely described as a "pretty clear promise of a war crime" and was condemned by the international community. However, on Sunday, Donald Trump renewed the threat, and said "They're allowed to kill our people, ...and we're not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn't work that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/06/suleimani-killing-donald-trump-defends-threat-to-hit-cultural-sites-in-iran|title=Trump defends ‘war crime’ threat to target cultural sites in Iran|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/05/world/trump-iran-cultural-sites-war-crime/index.html|title=Trump's threatened attack on Iranian cultural sites could be a war crime if carried out|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/06/trump-threat-destruction-iran-heritage-war-crime|title=Trump defends ‘war crime’ threat to target cultural sites in Iran|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/06/trump-threat-destruction-iran-heritage-war-crime|title=Trump's threat to destroy Iranian heritage would be a war crime|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/06/disturbing-history-behind-trumps-idea-target-iranian-cultural-sites/|title=The disturbing history behind Trump’s threat to target Iranian cultural sites|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51014237|title=Trump under fire for threat to Iranian cultural sites|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/01/06/794006073/trump-says-hell-target-iran-s-cultural-sites-that-s-illegal|title=Trump Says He'll Target Iran's Cultural Sites.

== Threats ==

=== First threat ===
In a series of tweets, Trump wrote that "if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets," the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites, "some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD."&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;

=== Second threat ===
A day after the first threat, Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, defended his threat and said: "They’re allowed to kill our people, They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn’t work that way.”&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== United States ===
The Pentagon tried to distance itself from Trump's tweets about targeting cultural sites. Defense Secretary Mark Esper was asked if the US would target cultural sites, and he said that the US will “follow the laws of armed conflict.”&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt; When asked if that meant "no, because targeting a cultural site is a war crime?", Esper said "That's the laws of armed conflict." However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump's tweets.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

US senators Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy labeled the tweets as "threatening to commit war crimes."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that "Threatening to target and kill innocent families, women and children - which is what you’re doing by targeting cultural sites - does not make you a “tough guy.” It does not make you “strategic.” It makes you a monster."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-rebuke-trump-for-targeting-52-iranian-sites-threatenign-war-crimes|title=AOC calls Trump 'a monster' over threat to Iran; Omar, other Democrats warn of potential 'war crimes'|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Biden also warned against "Trump's irrational behavior."&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; "The President of the United States is threatening to commit war crimes on Twitter. God help us all!", said Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

=== Iran ===
Iran's Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif, said Trump violated international law in “Friday’s cowardly assassinations” and “threatens to commit again new breaches of JUS COGENS. Targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME.”&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

In another tweet, Zarif wrote: "A reminder to those hallucinating about emulating ISIS war crimes by targeting our cultural heritage: Through MILLENNIA of history, barbarians have come and ravaged our cities, razed our monuments and burnt our libraries. Where are they now? We're still here, &amp; standing tall."&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

"Like ISIS, like Hitler, Like Genghis! They all hate cultures. Trump is a ‘terrorist in a suit.’ He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat ‘the Great Iranian Nation &amp; Culture", wrote Azari Jahromi, Iran's Minister of Communications and Information Technology, on Twitter.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

Iranian President Rouhani responded to Trump's warning: "Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290", referring to the 1988 shooting down of an Iran Air Flight 655, by a U.S. warship in which 290 were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/476970-rouhani-points-to-downing-of-iranian-airliner |title=Rouhani points to US downing of Iranian airliner in response to Trump threat |date=6 January 2020 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=9 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107065435/https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/476970-rouhani-points-to-downing-of-iranian-airliner |archive-date=7 January 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the hashtag #IranianCulturalSites, Iranian people responded to the Trump's tweets by sharing photos of their favorite Iranian cultural sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/05/iranians-flood-twitter-photos-favorite-cultural-sites-trump-threatens-them|title=Iranians Flood Twitter With Photos of Favorite Cultural Sites as Trump Threatens Them With Destruction|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC reported that Trump's tweets made Iranians, who were divided as soon as the news of the killing of Qasem Soleimani broke, united against the United States.

=== Worldwide ===
Audrey Azoulay, the director general of the UN's cultural organisation, Unesco, said both Iran and the US had signed a 1972 convention to protect the world's natural and cultural heritage. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said cultural sites were protected by international law. He also said that Britain expected that to be respected.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson warned the US that "attacking Iranian cultural sites could constitute a war crime under international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/iran-war-trump-boris-johnson-cultural-sites-soleimani-iraq-a9272076.html|title=Iran crisis: Boris Johnson warns Trump not to break international law by bombing cultural sites|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francesco Bandarin, a former senior official at UNESCO, wrote "if the US destroys Iranian cultural sites, President Trump will be criminally liable by international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/analysis/if-the-us-destroys-iranian-cultural-sites-president-trump-will-be-criminally-liable-by-international-law|title=If the US destroys Iranian cultural sites, President Trump will be criminally liable by international law|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, without mentioning Trump, stressed that international cooperation must continue to preserve humanity's treasures.&lt;ref name="apnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/e456bc97066894a04b23b384fec6cded|title=Trump retreats from threat to attack Iranian cultural sites|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
On Tuesday, Donald Trump backed away from his threats to target Iranian cultural sites. "I like to obey the law." he said during an Oval Office appearance. He also added: "Think of it. They kill our people. They blow up our people. And then we have to be very gentle with their cultural institutions? But I’m OK with it. It’s OK with me.”&lt;ref name="apnews.com"/&gt;

The '''impeachment of Donald Trump''', the 45th [[president of the United States]], was initiated on December 18, 2019, when the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] approved [[articles of impeachment]] on charges of [[abuse of power]] and [[obstruction of Congress]]. Trump was later acquitted by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on these two counts of impeachment on February 5, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/801429948/not-guilty-trump-acquitted-on-2-articles-of-impeachment-as-historic-trial-closes 'Not Guilty': Trump Acquitted On 2 Articles Of Impeachment As Historic Trial Closes] by Philip Ewing, [[NPR]], February 5, 2020, 4:33 PM ET&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s impeachment came after [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|a formal House inquiry]] alleged that he had solicited [[Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections|foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election]] to help his [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|re-election bid]], and then obstructed the inquiry itself by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony. The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]&lt;ref name="Zelensky bowed until luck" /&gt;}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump–Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].

The inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13–9 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23–17 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a mostly party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019). 

The articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S. senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office. Until Mitt Romney|date=February 5, 2020|website=[[Washington Post]]|language=en|access-date=February 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the acquittal, Trump fired two witnesses, [[Gordon Sondland]] and [[Alexander Vindman]], who had in the impeachment inquiry testified about his conduct. Vindman's brother was also fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|last3=Hakim|first3=Danny|last4=Schmidt|first4=Michael S.|date=2020-02-07|title=Trump Fires Impeachment Witnesses Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman in Post-Acquittal Purge|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-gordon-sondland-fired.html|access-date=2020-06-01|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immediate response ===
The day after Trump's impeachment, the evangelical magazine ''[[Christianity Today]]'' published an editorial calling for his removal from office, stating that the president "attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president's political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december-web-only/trump-should-be-removed-from-office.html|title=Trump Should Be Removed from Office|last=Galli|first=Mark|date=December 19, 2019|website=Christianity Today|url-status=live|access-date=December 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-19dec2019"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/19/trump-evangelical-christian-magazine-impeachment|title=Evangelical magazine Christianity Today calls for Trump's removal after impeachment|last1=Ho|first1=Vivian|date=December 19, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 21, conservative [[Bill Kristol]] and a group calling itself "Republicans for the Rule of Law" released an ad encouraging viewers to call their senators to demand top Trump officials be forced to testify in his impeachment trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=December 21, 2019|accessdate=December 23, 2019|title=Witnesses 'Must Testify' At Impeachment Trial, Declares GOP Group.

{{Main|Impeachment trial of Donald Trump}}

=== Preparation ===
While the impeachment inquiry was underway, Senate majority leader [[Mitch McConnell]] started planning a possible trial. On October 8, 2019, he led a meeting on the subject, advising his caucus to say that they opposed the House process and as little else as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-impeachment-senate-republicans-20191109-bsrbhhe37vdy3bcdirub7lo4bm-story.html|title=How Mitch McConnell is managing impeachment and a fragmenting Republican response|last=Mascaro|first=Lisa|date=November 9, 2019|website=Chicago Tribune|url-status=live|access-date=December 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, he shot down the idea that the articles of impeachment should be dismissed, saying, "The rules of impeachment are very clear, we'll have to have a trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carney |first1=Jordain |title=GOP senator plans to seek dismissal of impeachment articles |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/476582-gop-senator-plans-to-seek-dismissal-of-impeachment-articles |accessdate=January 3, 2020 |work=TheHill |date=January 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, as the articles were being considered by the House Judiciary Committee, McConnell met with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Director of Legislative Affairs [[Eric Ueland]].&lt;ref name="dictatetrial"/&gt; McConnell stated later that day, "Everything I do during this I'm coordinating with the White House counsel.

=== Officers ===
The U.S. Constitution stipulated that the Supreme Court's chief justice presides over impeachment proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Index/Impeachment.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Impeachment |publisher=Senate.gov |date=January 13, 1993 |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nina |last=Totenberg |authorlink=Nina Totenberg |date=January 10, 2020 |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/01/10/794749544/at-impeachment-trial-chief-justice-roberts-may-have-more-prestige-than-power|title=At Impeachment Trial, Chief Justice Roberts May Have More Prestige Than Power|website=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The office of Chief Justice is only mentioned once in the constitution and it is in relation to impeachment trials of the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steven R. |last=Shapiro |date=September 12, 2005 |accessdate=January 27, 2020 |url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/speakeasy/role-chief-justice|title=The Role of Chief Justice|website=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The current chief justice was [[John Roberts]], who was appointed by [[George W.

=== Process and schedule ===
[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Trial of Impeachment|Article I, Section 3, Clause 6]] of the U.S. Constitution stated that "[t]he Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments."&lt;ref name="const" /&gt; Per the Senate's impeachment rules adopted in 1986, the submission of the articles to the Senate initiated the trial.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web |title=Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SMAN-113/pdf/SMAN-113-pg223.pdf |website=U.S. Government Publishing Office |accessdate=January 3, 2020 |p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; The articles were formally delivered on January 15, 2020, and were presented on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51139740|title=Impeachment trial: Why did Pelosi use so many pens?|agency=[[BBC]]|date=January 16, 2020|accessdate=January 16, 2020|author=Helier Cheung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the January 21 session, the Senate voted along party lines to pass McConnell's proposed trial rules and reject 11 amendments proposed by Democrats.&lt;ref name=rulez&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fox |first1=Lauren |last2=Raju |first2=Manu |last3=Herb |first3=Jeremy |title=Impeachment resolution shortens trial's opening arguments to two days per side |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/20/politics/senate-organizing-resolution-released/index.html |accessdate=January 20, 2020 |work=CNN |date=January 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell has stated that he wants to follow the rules laid down in 1999, which had the morning reserved for Senate business and the afternoon hours reserved for the trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=January 27, 2020 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/senaterules.htm|work=The Washington Post|title= Special Report: Clinton Accused}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his resolution increased the hours spent per day on opening arguments from 6 to 8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Faulders |first1=Katherine |last2=Turner |first2=Trish |last3=Siegel |first3=Benjamin |last4=Ebbs |first4=Stephanie |last5=Owen |first5=Quinn |title=Trump impeachment: GOP-led Senate rejects amendments, approves rules of trial |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates-senate-rejects-democrats/story?id=68410003 |accessdate=January 22, 2020 |work=ABC News |date=January 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution also includes provisions for a vote on whether to subpoena witnesses or documents after opening arguments.&lt;ref name=rulez/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate adopts ground rules for impeachment trial, delaying a decision on witnesses until after much of the proceedings |first=Seung Min |last=Kim |first2=Felicia |last2=Sonmez |first3=Mike |last3=DeBonis |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-ease-some-restrictions-as-trump-impeachment-trial-kicks-into-gear/2020/01/21/b0514516-3c75-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html |date=January 22, 2020 |accessdate=January 22, 2020 |newspaper=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate adopts trial rules after bitter debate over evidence. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/impeachment-trial-01-21/senate-trial-rules |accessdate=January 22, 2020 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the trial, in mid-January 2020, Americans were sharply divided on whether Trump should be removed from office, with Democrats largely supporting removal, Republicans largely opposing, and independents divided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/ |title=Do Americans Support Impeaching Trump? |last=Bycoffe |first=Aaron |date=January 20, 2019 |website=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=January 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115143750/https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/ |archive-date=January 15, 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[USA Today]]''/[[Suffolk University]] poll conducted on December 10–14, 2019, found that 45% of respondents supported the impeachment and removal of Trump from office, while 51% opposed it.&lt;ref name="USAToday 12_16" /&gt; A [[CNN]] poll conducted on December 12–15 also found 45% supported impeachment and removal, compared to 47% who opposed the idea.&lt;ref name="CNN 12_17" /&gt; A [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll released on the day of Trump's impeachment found that Trump's approval rating increased by 6 points during the impeachment process, while support for the impeachment fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/271691/trump-approval-inches-support-impeachment-dips.aspx|title=Trump Approval Inches Up, While Support for Impeachment Dips|last=McCarthy|first=Justin|date=December 18, 2019|website=Gallup|url-status=live|access-date=December 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another CNN poll conducted on January 16–19, 2020, found that 51% supported Trump's removal from office, compared to 45% who opposed the idea.&lt;ref name="CNN 01_20"/&gt; An NBC/''The Wall Street Journal'' poll released on January 2, 2020 showed 46% favored removal from office and 49% opposed, with the in favor/opposed being almost exclusively along party lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/nbc-wsj-poll-country-remains-divided-over-trump-s-impeachment-n1128326|title=NBC/WSJ poll: Country remains divided over Trump's impeachment trial|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=February 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

Two days after Trump was acquitted by the Senate in the impeachment trial, he fired two witnesses who testified in the impeachment inquiry about his conduct.&lt;ref name=vindsond&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baker |first1=Peter |last2=Haberman |first2=Maggie |last3=Hakim |first3=Danny |last4=Schmidt |first4=Michael |title=Trump Fires Impeachment Witnesses Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman in Post-Acquittal Purge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-gordon-sondland-fired.html |accessdate=February 9, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 7, 2020 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/LWHJM |archivedate=February 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vinsub&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump defends firing impeachment witness Alexander Vindman |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51408704 |accessdate=February 9, 2020 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=February 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 7, Gordon Sondland's ambassadorship was terminated, while Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was escorted from the White House after a dismissal from his job on the National Security Council. At the same time, Vindman's twin brother, Yevgeny, likewise an Army Lieutenant Colonel on the National Security Council, was also dismissed.&lt;ref name=vindsond/&gt; Shortly before the firings, Trump stated that he was "not happy" with Alexander Vindman; after the firings, Trump stated that he "didn't know" Alexander Vindman but "he was very insubordinate".&lt;ref name=vinsub/&gt; Alexander Vindman's lawyer responded that his client "was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful." Sondland reacted by stating that he was "grateful to President Trump" for the "opportunity to serve".&lt;ref name=vindsond/&gt;

In April 2020, Trump fired [[Michael K. Atkinson]], the inspector general of the intelligence community.&lt;ref&gt;|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/trump-inspector-general-intelligence-fired.amp.html. |accessdate=April 3, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 3, 2020&lt;/ref&gt;
When Trump was asked about the firing the next day, he criticized Atkinson as having done a "terrible job": "took a fake report and he brought it to Congress", in reference to the whistleblower complaint of the Trump–Ukraine scandal, which was actually largely verified by other testimony and evidence. Trump further complained that Atkinson "never even came in to see me. How can you [forward the complaint] without seeing the person?" Trump concluded that Atkinson was "not a big Trump fan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baker |first1=Peter |title=Trump Proceeds With Post-Impeachment Purge Amid Pandemic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-post-impeachment-purge.html |accessdate=April 24, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 4, 2020 |archiveurl=http://archive.today/QED7L |archivedate=April 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cook |first1=Nancy |title=Sideshow Don: Trump pursues a non-virus agenda |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/04/trump-non-coronavirus-agenda-165086 |accessdate=April 24, 2020 |work=[[Politico]] |date=April 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkinson responded that he believed Trump had fired him for "having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General, and from my commitment to continue to do so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bowden |first1=John |title=Outgoing inspector general says Trump fired him for carrying out his 'legal obligations' |url=https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/491283-outgoing-inspector-general-suggests-trump-fired-him-for-carrying-out |accessdate=April 24, 2020 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=April 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''presidency of Donald Trump''' began at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (17:00 UTC) on January 20, 2017, when [[Donald Trump]] was [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inaugurated]] as the [[List of presidents of the United States|45th]] [[president of the United States]], succeeding [[Barack Obama]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Trump was a businessman and [[reality television]] personality from [[New York City]] at the time of his [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]]. While Trump lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes, he won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote, 304 to 227,&lt;!-- WP:CWW the following was copied from the lead of Donald Trump February 20, 2019; it is from an earlier RFC there; wikilink snf some similar cites added. --&gt; in a presidential contest that American intelligence agencies concluded was targeted by [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|a Russian interference campaign]]. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, with political scientists and historians widely describing the phenomenon as unprecedented in modern American politics.&lt;!-- End of CWW material --&gt; Trump's approval rating has been stable, hovering at high-30 to mid-40 percent throughout his presidency.

Trump rolled back numerous [[Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration|environmental protections]], as well as reduced enforcement of existing regulations. He ended the [[Clean Power Plan]], [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|withdrew]] from the [[Paris Agreement]] on [[climate change mitigation]], and urged for subsidies to increase fossil fuel production, calling man-made climate change a hoax. Trump failed in his efforts to repeal the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA), but took numerous actions that hindered its functioning and sought to have the courts rule it unconstitutional. Despite pledges made as a candidate, President Trump sought substantial spending cuts to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], [[Social Security Disability Insurance|Social Security]] and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]. He enacted [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act|a partial repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act]] (that had previously imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the [[2008 financial crisis]]), hindered the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] in policing fraud and protecting consumers, and withdrew from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]. Trump signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which lowered corporate and estate taxes permanently, and lowered most individual income tax rates temporarily while increasing them for some. He enacted [[Trump tariffs|tariffs]] on steel and aluminum imports and other goods, triggering retaliatory tariffs from [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and the [[European Union]], and [[2018 China–United States trade war|a trade war with China]]. These tariffs adversely affected the U.S. economy. For most of Trump's term until 2020, the economy kept improving, following trends from the Obama presidency. The federal deficit soared under Trump due to spending increases and tax cuts.

Trump's "America First" foreign policy has featured more unilateral American actions, disregarding the advice and support of many traditional allies while drawing the United States closer to others like [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Israel]]. Despite pledges to reduce the U.S. military personnel deployed overseas, the number was essentially the same three years into Trump's presidency as they were at the end of Obama's. Trump's administration [[2017 United States–Saudi Arabia arms deal|agreed to sell $110 billion of arms to Saudi Arabia]], [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and issued [[Executive Order 13769|a controversial executive order]] denying citizens from several Muslim-majority countries entry into the U.S. His administration [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War|withdrew U.S. troops]] from northern Syria, allowing [[2019 Rojava offensive|Turkey to attack American-allied Kurds]]. The Trump administration unilaterally decided to hold talks with North Korea, with Trump saying he and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un "fell in love". Trump [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew the United States from the Iran Deal]] (at the time, Iran was in compliance with the terms of the agreement), and escalated the dispute with Iran by assassinating Iranian General [[Qasem Soleimani]]. Since US withdrawal from the Iran Deal, Iran has increased its stockpiles of enriched uranium. [[Mexico–United States barrier#Trump administration|Trump's demand for federal funding of a U.S.–Mexico border wall]] resulted in [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019|the 2018–2019 government shutdown]] (the longest in American history) and followed with Trump's declaration of a [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States|national emergency regarding the U.S. southern border]]. He ended the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program which had provided temporary protection for undocumented immigrants brought into the U.S. as minors. The Trump administration implemented a family separation policy for migrants apprehended at the U.S.–Mexico border, controversially separating parents from their children, resulting in bipartisan condemnation and international outcry.

After Trump [[Dismissal of James Comey|dismissed]] FBI Director [[James Comey]] in May 2017, a former FBI director, [[Robert Mueller]], was appointed as [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|special counsel]] to take over [[Operation Crossfire Hurricane|a prior FBI investigation]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 elections]] and related matters, including coordination or [[Links between Trump associates and Russian officials|links]] between the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] and the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]]. Six Trump campaign advisers and staff were indicted and five pled guilty to [[Criminal charges brought in the Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|criminal charges]]. Trump repeatedly denied [[Conspiracy|collusion]] or [[obstruction of justice]], and frequently criticized the investigation, calling it a politically motivated "[[Witch hunt#Figurative use of the term|witch hunt]]". Mueller concluded his investigation in March 2019, with a report of the probe showing Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's. The report concluded the prevailing evidence "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" but documented ten actions by the Trump presidency that could be construed as obstruction of justice. The Mueller team could not indict Trump once investigators decided to abide by an [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and did not exonerate Trump on this issue. Barr and Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] decided the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate a criminal offense of obstruction. Barr later said he had not exonerated Trump.

[[United States House of Representatives|The House of Representatives]] launched [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|an impeachment inquiry]] following a September 2019 report that Trump had [[Abuse of power|abused his presidential power]] by [[Trump-Ukraine scandal|pressuring the president of Ukraine]] to undertake actions which would [[Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections|have the effect of helping Trump's 2020 re-election campaign]]. Among other inducements, Trump ordered congressionally-mandated military aid for Ukraine to be withheld. Witnesses subsequently testified that he and his surrogates had been carrying out that pressure campaign for months. On December 18, 2019, Trump became the third president in American history to be [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|impeached]]. The [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|trial]] took place from January 16 to February 5, 2020; he was acquitted of all charges.

The final year of Trump's current term was marked by the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

Trump won 304 electoral votes compared to Clinton's 227, though Clinton won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote, receiving nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump.

===Notable departures===

{{main|List of Trump administration dismissals and resignations}}

====Firing of Michael Flynn====

On February 13, 2017, Trump fired Michael Flynn from the post of National Security Adviser on grounds that he had lied to Vice President Pence about his communications with Russian Ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]]; Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia.&lt;ref name=":67"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goldman|first=Adam|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|date=2020-05-14|title=Trump White House Changes Its Story on Michael Flynn|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/us/politics/trump-michael-flynn.html|access-date=2020-05-20|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn was fired amidst the ongoing controversy concerning [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 election]] and accusations that Trump's electoral team colluded with Russian agents. In May 2017, [[Sally Yates]] testified before the Senate Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism that she had told White House Counsel Don McGahn in late January 2017 Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials and warned McGahn that Flynn was potentially compromised by Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sally Yates says she warned White House that Flynn was a blackmail risk|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/sally-yates-senate-testimony/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn remained in his post for another two weeks and was fired after ''[[The Washington Post]]'' broke the story. Yates was fired by Donald Trump on January 30 because "she defiantly refused to defend his executive order closing the nation's borders to refugees and people from predominantly Muslim countries".&lt;ref name=NYT-Shear&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html|title=Trump Fires Acting Attorney General Who Defied Him|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|last2=Landler|first2=Mark|author2link=Mark Landler|last3=Apuzzo|first3=Matt|author3link=Matt Apuzzo|last4=Lichtblau|first4=Eric|author4link=Eric Lichtblau|date=January 30, 2017|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Flynn having pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and Pence stating that Flynn lied to him, the Trump administration began in 2020 to promote a narrative that Flynn had been unfairly targeted. Senior administration officials (including Pence) said Flynn would be welcome back into the administration.&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt; 

====Firing of James Comey====

{{Main|Dismissal of James Comey}}

Trump dismissed [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI director]] [[James Comey]] on May 9, 2017, saying he had accepted the recommendations of Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions|Sessions]] and Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] to dismiss Comey. Sessions' recommendation was based on Rosenstein's, while Rosenstein wrote that Comey should be dismissed for his handling of the conclusion of the FBI investigation into the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gambacorta |first1=David |title=Rod Rosenstein: The one man standing in Trump's way is the president's polar opposite |url=https://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/rod-rosenstein-trump-russia-investigation-robert-mueller-20180924.html |website=[[philly.com]] |accessdate=February 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, Trump met Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] and Russian Ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]]. Based on White House notes of [[Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information|the meeting]], Trump told the Russians: "I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job{{nbsp}}...

====Resignation of Jim Mattis====

Secretary of Defense [[Jim Mattis]] informed Trump of his resignation following Trump's abrupt December 19, 2018, announcement that the remaining 2,000 American troops in Syria would be withdrawn, against the recommendations of his military and civilian advisors. In his resignation letter, Mattis appeared to criticize Trump's worldview, praising NATO, which Trump has often derided, as well as the Defeat-ISIS coalition Trump had just decided to abandon. Mattis' resignation became effective on February 28, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-sad-day-for-america-washington-fears-a-trump-unchecked-by-mattis/2018/12/20/faef8da0-04ac-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html|title='A sad day for America': Washington fears a Trump unchecked by Mattis|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firing of inspector generals ===
Trump fired numerous [[Inspector general|Inspector Generals]] of agencies, including those were probing the Trump administration and close Trump associates. In 2020, he fired five inspector generals in two months. ''The Washington Post'' wrote, "For the first time since the system was created in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, inspectors general find themselves under systematic attack from the president, putting independent oversight of federal spending and operations at risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=2020|title=As Trump removes federal watchdogs, some loyalists replacing them have ‘preposterous’ conflicts|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-trump-removes-federal-watchdogs-some-loyalists-replacing-them-have-extensive-conflicts/2020/05/24/8dad46a4-9b89-11ea-a2b3-5c3f2d1586df_story.html|url-status=live|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial nominees==

{{Further|Donald Trump Supreme Court candidates|List of federal judges appointed by Donald Trump|Donald Trump judicial appointment controversies}}

Trump nominated and the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court justices: [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]]. Trump [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] Gorsuch, a federal appellate judge, to fill the vacancy which arose after the February 2016 death of [[Antonin Scalia]] and which had not been filled under the then-president Obama because of Republican obstruction.&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/mcconnell-cements-a-legacy-for-trump-with-reshaped-u-s-courts|title=McConnell Cements a Legacy for Trump With Reshaped Courts|date=April 27, 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate in a 54–45 vote.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court.html|title=Neil Gorsuch Confirmed by Senate as Supreme Court Justice|last=Liptak|first=Adam |authorlink=Adam Liptak |date=April 7, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=April 7, 2017|last2=Flegenheimer|first2=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this nomination, the support of three-fifths of the Senate had effectively been required for the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees due to the Senate [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]]. However, the Senate's Republican majority changed the rules for the filibuster via the so-called "[[nuclear option]]", and the confirmation of Supreme Court justices now requires only a simple majority vote.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

In July 2018, Trump [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] Brett Kavanaugh, a [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] judge, to fill the vacancy left by [[Anthony Kennedy]], widely considered to be the key swing vote on the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barnes |first1=Robert |title=Justice Kennedy, the pivotal swing vote on the Supreme Court, announces his retirement |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/justice-kennedy-the-pivotal-swing-vote-on-the-supreme-court-announces-retirement/2018/06/27/a40a8c64-5932-11e7-a204-ad706461fa4f_story.html |accessdate=August 26, 2018 |newspaper=Washington Post |date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|confirmation process]], Kavanaugh was accused of sexually assaulting Dr. [[Christine Blasey Ford]] while they were both in high school.

As president, the number and scale of Trump's false statements in public speeches, remarks, and in [[Twitter#Tweets|tweets]] has been identified by scholars, fact-checkers, and commentators as unprecedented for an American president or even unprecedented in U.S. politics.&lt;ref name=McGranahan&gt;Carole McGranahan, [https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/amet.12475 An anthropology of lying: Trump and the political sociality of moral outrage], ''[[American Ethnologist]]'', Vol. 44, Issue 2 (April 2017): "Donald Trump is different.

Shortly before Trump secured the 2016 Republican nomination, ''The New York Times'' reported "legal experts across the political spectrum say" Trump's rhetoric reflected "a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law," adding "many conservative and libertarian legal scholars warn that electing Mr. Trump is a recipe for a constitutional crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/us/politics/donald-trump-constitution-power.html|title=Donald Trump Could Threaten U.S. Rule of Law, Scholars Say|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientists warned that candidate Trump's rhetoric and actions mimicked those of other politicians who ultimately turned authoritarian once in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|title=How democracies die|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1019872575|volume=|pages=|isbn=978-0-525-58795-8|oclc=1019872575|access-date=2020-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as president and owing in large part due to his actions and rhetoric, the United States experienced [[democratic backsliding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Robert C.|last2=Mettler|first2=Suzanne|last3=Pepinsky|first3=Thomas B.|last4=Roberts|first4=Kenneth M.|last5=Valelly|first5=Richard|date=2019|title=The Trump Presidency and American Democracy: A Historical and Comparative Analysis|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/trump-presidency-and-american-democracy-a-historical-and-comparative-analysis/E157E9BBA8D3E531A7DD4FD1A01E0478#.XrS0MSOp6ko.twitter|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=470–479|doi=10.1017/S1537592718003286|issn=1537-5927|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Robert R.|last2=Haggard|first2=Stephan|date=2018|title=Democratic Decline in the United States: What Can We Learn from Middle-Income Backsliding?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1537592718003377|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=17|issue=02|pages=417–432|doi=10.1017/s1537592718003377|issn=1537-5927|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr, are troubling in the extreme."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/opinion/FBI-Trump-russia-investigation.html|title=Opinion—I Headed the F.B.I. and C.I.A.

===Relationship with the news media===

Early into his presidency, Trump developed a highly contentious relationship with the news media, repeatedly referring to them as the "[[fake news]] media" and "the [[enemy of the people]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bondarenko|first1=Veronika|title=Trump keeps saying 'enemy of the people'—but the phrase has a very ugly history|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-president-trumps-phrase-an-enemy-of-the-people-2017-2|website=Business Insider|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a candidate, Trump had refused press credentials for offending publications but said he would not do so if elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/06/14/media/donald-trump-press-credentials-access/index.html|title=Donald Trump: I won't kick reporters out of White House press briefing room |last=Stelter |first=Brian |work=CNN Business |date=June 14, 2016 |access-date=December 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Trump both privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' [[White House press corps|White House press credentials]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/09/media/president-trump-press-credentials/index.html|title=Trump's latest shot at the press corps: 'Take away credentials?'|last=Collins|first=Brian Stelter and Kaitlan|work=CNNMoney|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Trump White House gave temporary press passes to far-right pro-Trump fringe outlets, such as ''[[InfoWars]]'' and ''[[The Gateway Pundit]]'', which are known for publishing hoaxes and conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/infowars-granted-white-house-press-credentials-2017-5?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Conspiracy outlet InfoWars was granted temporary White House press credentials|work=Business Insider|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grynbaum_2/13/2017"&gt;{{cite news | last=Grynbaum | first=Michael M. | title=White House Grants Press Credentials to a Pro-Trump Blog | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 13, 2017 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/business/the-gateway-pundit-trump.html | access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his first day in office, Trump falsely accused journalists of understating the size of the crowd at his inauguration, and called the news media "among the most dishonest human beings on earth". Trump's claims were notably defended by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who claimed the inauguration crowd had been the biggest in history, a claim disproven by photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html|title=With False Claims, Trump Attacks Media on Turnout and Intelligence Rift|first1=Julie Hirschfeld|last1=Davis|first2=Matthew|last2=Rosenberg|date=January 21, 2017 |accessdate=April 30, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway then defended Spicer when asked about the falsehood, saying it was an "[[alternative fact]]", not a falsehood.&lt;ref name="Jaffe_1/22/2017" /&gt;

On February 16, 2017, less than a month into his presidency, Trump held a press conference during which he claimed the news media were not speaking for the people, but for "[[special interest]]s". He said they were dishonest, out of control and doing a disservice to the American people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript.html "Full Transcript and Video: Trump News Conference"], ''The New York Times'', February 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Trump tweeted, "The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=Trump makes it explicit: Negative coverage of him is fake coverage | website=Washington Post | date=May 9, 2018 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/09/trump-makes-it-explicit-negative-coverage-of-him-is-fake-coverage/ | accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/02/17/president-donald-trump-twitter-media-enemy-of-the-american-people/|title=Trump Calls Media 'Enemy Of The American People' In Latest Attack|agency=Associated Press|publisher=KPIX |date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump did not hold another formal press conference for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's last press conference |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/trumps-last-press-conference/2140/ |accessdate=January 12, 2019 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than press conferences, Trump preferred to engage with the press in informal "gaggles" on the White House lawn as he prepared to board his helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trumps-favorite-venue-for-making-news--or-avoiding-it--is-right-in-front-of-the-presidential-chopper/2019/10/23/7a1df9ca-de4d-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html|title=Trump's favorite venue for making news—or avoiding it—is right in front of the presidential chopper|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=October 23, 2019|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the month, the administration blocked reporters from ''The New York Times'', BuzzFeed News, CNN, ''Los Angeles Times'' and ''Politico'' from attending an off-camera briefing with Press Secretary [[Sean Spicer]]. Reporters from ''Time'' magazine and The Associated Press chose not to attend the briefing in protest at the White House's actions. ''The New York Times'' described the move as "a highly unusual breach of relations between the White House and its press corps", and the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] issued a statement of protest.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/us/politics/white-house-sean-spicer-briefing.html|title=White House Bars Times and 2 Other News Outlets From Briefing|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|date=February 24, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/reporters-blocked-white-house-gaggle-235360|title=White House selectively blocks media outlets from briefing with Spicer|last=Gold|first=Hadas|date=February 24, 2017|newspaper=Politico|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Trump, the news media, and fake news has been studied. One study found that between October{{nbsp}}7 and November 14, 2016, while one in four Americans visited a [[fake news website]], "Trump supporters visited the most fake news websites, which were overwhelmingly pro-Trump" and "almost 6{{nbsp}}in 10 visits to fake news websites came from the 10% of people with the most conservative online information diets".&lt;ref name="Guess_Nyhan_Reifler_1/9/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Guess | first1=Andrew | last2=Nyhan | first2=Brendan | last3=Reifler | first3=Jason | date=January 9, 2018 | title=Selective Exposure to Misinformation: Evidence from the consumption of fake news during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign | website=Dartmouth.edu | url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-2016.pdf | accessdate=February 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allcott"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=H.

In August 2018, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called for a nationwide refutation of Trump's "dirty war" against the news media, with the hashtag #EnemyOfNone. More than 300 news outlets joined the campaign. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Trump's attacks "dangerous to the lifeblood of democracy" and published excerpts from dozens of further publications. ''[[The New York Post]]'' wrote, "It may be frustrating to argue that just because we print inconvenient truths doesn't mean that we're fake news, but being a journalist isn't a popularity contest. All we can do is to keep reporting." ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote, "If the press is not free from reprisal, punishment or suspicion for unpopular views or information, neither is the country.

By late 2019, his style of communications to the public had evolved. According to a report in ''Politico'':
:He prefers to issue major announcements himself over social media, whether policy moves or staff firings. He killed the daily White House briefing, preferring the messy practice of fielding reporters' shouted questions from the Oval Office or before his presidential helicopter. As Year Three of his presidency closes out, Trump has built his style of communicating around the pillars of political grievances, conspiracy theories and targeting perceived enemies. Most of all, he prefers to dictate and dominate the news cycle.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/11/trump-instincts-unimpeachable-presidency-ukraine-069015 Nancy Cook, "Trump's bluster crashes into a barrage of impeachment facts: The president's confident, solo style is set to collide with Democratic efforts to publicly expose his actions over Ukraine aid."

Several groups and individuals, including former [[Secretary of Labor]] [[Robert Reich]] have criticised Trump for spending too much time on Twitter, stating that it prevents him from governing effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/donald-trump-coronavirus-pandemic-george-floyd-minneapolis-tweets?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_rif_is_fun|title=Fire, pestilence and a country at war with itself: the Trump presidency is over|website=The Guardian|last1=Reich|first1=Robert|date=May 31, 2020|accessdate=May 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2019 poll by [[Morning Consult]], 72% of Americans think Trump spends too much time on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://morningconsult.com/2019/10/09/when-it-comes-to-trumps-twitter-use-heres-where-people-draw-the-lines/|title=When It Comes to Trump’s Twitter Use, Here’s Where People Draw the Lines|website=Morning Consult|last1=Sabin|first1=Sam|date=October 9, 2019|accessdate=May 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial criticism of Trump===

On November 6, 2019, [[United States federal judge|Senior United States District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] and secretary of the [[American Law Institute]] [[Paul L. Friedman]] said Trump's rhetoric "violates all recognized democratic norms" and that "We are witnessing a chief executive who criticizes virtually every judicial decision that doesn't go his way and denigrates judges who rule against him, sometimes in very personal terms. He seems to view the courts and the justice system as obstacles to be attacked and undermined, not as a coequal branch to be respected even when he disagrees with its decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shepherd |first1=Katie |title=Trump 'violates all recognized democratic norms', federal judge says in biting speech on judicial independence |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/08/judge-says-trump-violates-democratic-norms-judiciary-speech/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2020, Trump tweeted criticism of the prosecutors' proposed sentence for Trump's former aide [[Roger Stone]]. A few hours later, the Department of Justice replaced the prosecutors' proposed sentence with a lighter proposal. This gave the appearance of presidential interference in a criminal case and caused a strongly negative reaction. All four of the original prosecutors withdrew from the case; more than a thousand former DOJ prosecutors signed a letter condemning the action; and the Federal Judges Association, which represents more than 1,100 federal judges, called an emergency meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/16/us/politics/barr-trump-justice-department.html|title=Former Justice Dept.

===2020 protests===
Amid widespread protests against police violence after Minneapolis police killed [[Death of George Floyd|George Floyd]], a black man, by kneeling on his neck for an extended period, Trump tweeted a 1967 quote, "[[when the looting starts, the shooting starts]]", from the racist Miami police chief Walter E.

===Abortion and fetal tissue research===

{{Further|Social policy of Donald Trump#Abortion}}

Trump reinstated the [[Mexico City policy]] prohibiting funding to foreign [[non-governmental organization]]s that perform abortions as a method of family planning in other countries.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/18/latest-un-draft-resolution-america-has-problem-with-one-condemning-violence-against-girls/|title=U.S. alone in its opposition to parts of a U.N. draft resolution addressing violence against girls|date=2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the U.S. was the only country to oppose a United Nations nonbinding draft resolution to combat violence against women; the administration said a reference to "sexual and reproductive health" could be interpreted as support for abortion rights, and that the resolution might conflate "physical violence against women with sexual harassment".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In 2018, the administration prohibited scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from acquiring new fetal tissue for research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/12/trump-administration-has-quietly-barred-nih-scientists-acquiring-fetal-tissue|title=Updated: NIH says cancer study also hit by fetal tissue ban|last=Wadm|first=Meredith|date=December 7, 2018|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en|access-date=December 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a year later stopped all medical research by government scientists that used fetal tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/trump-ending-fetal-tissue-research-federal-scientists-63506968|title=Trump halts fetal tissue research by government scientists|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=June 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration geared HHS funding towards abstinence education programs for teens rather than the comprehensive sexual education programs the Obama administration funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/384208-trump-admin-announces-abstinence-focused-overhaul-of-teen-pregnancy|title=Trump admin announces abstinence-focused overhaul of teen pregnancy program|last=Hellmann|first=Jessie|date=April 20, 2018|work=TheHill|access-date=October 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his January 2019 State of the Union Address Trump said he would push for a ban on late-term abortions, falsely asserting that a New York law would allow "a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-abortion-state-union-late-term-execute-baby-virginia-new-york-law-congress-a8765076.html|title=Trump says ban late-term abortion to stop babies from being 'ripped from mother's womb' in controversial State of the Union address|last=Buncombe|first=Andrew|date=February 5, 2019|work=The Independent|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On multiple occasions in 2019 he falsely claimed that Democrats favor allowing doctors and mothers to "execute" live-born babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/politics/trump-abortion-fact-check.html|title=Trump Repeats a False Claim That Doctors 'Execute' Newborns|first=Chris|last=Cameron|date=April 28, 2019|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/feb/28/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweet-saying-democrats/|title=Do Democrats not mind 'executing' babies, as Trump said?|website=Politifact|date=April 29, 2019|last=Greenberg|first=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration implemented a policy restricting taxpayer dollars given to family planning facilities through [[Title X|Title{{nbsp}}X]]. This policy requires that companies receiving Title{{nbsp}}X funding must not mention abortion to patients, provide abortion referrals, or share space with abortion providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/health/trump-defunds-planned-parenthood.html|title=Trump Administration Blocks Funds for Planned Parenthood and Others Over Abortion Referrals|last=Belluck|first=Pam|date=February 22, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 22, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-abortion-rules-referrals-clinic-locations-can-take-effect-during-n1020641|title=Trump abortion rules on referrals, clinic locations can take effect during appeals, court rules|date=June 22, 2019|work=NBC News|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Planned Parenthood]], which provides Title{{nbsp}}X birth control services to 1.5 million women, withdrew from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/planned-parenthood-withdraws-title-x-family-planning-program-n1044041|title=Planned Parenthood withdraws from Title X family planning program|last=Chuck|first=Elizabeth|date=August 19, 2019|work=NBC News|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===

Due to Trump's trade tariffs combined with depressed commodities prices, American farmers faced the worst crisis in decades.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Trump provided farmers $12 billion in direct payments in July 2018 to mitigate the negative impacts of his [[Trump tariffs|tariffs]], increasing the payments by $14.5 billion in May 2019 after trade talks with China ended without agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/farm-aid-package.html|title=Trump Gives Farmers $16 Billion in Aid Amid Prolonged China Trade War|last1=Swanson|first1=Ana|last2=Thrush|first2=Glenn|date=May 23, 2019|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the administration's aid went to the largest farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-30/majority-of-trump-s-trade-aid-went-to-biggest-farms-study-finds|title=Majority of Trump's Trade Aid Went to Biggest Farms, Study Finds|date=2019|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=July 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Politico'' reported in May 2019 that some economists in the Agriculture Department were being punished for presenting analyses showing farmers were being harmed by Trump's trade and tax policies, with six economists having more than 50 years of combined experience at the Service resigning on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump|url=https://politi.co/2J4A6tU|last=Mccrimmon|first=Ryan|website=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's fiscal 2020 budget proposed a 15% funding cut for the Agriculture Department, calling farm subsidies "overly generous".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-usda-idUSKBN1QS28Z|title=Trump budget proposes steep subsidy cuts to farmers as they grapple{{nbsp}}... |date=March 11, 2019|via=www.reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Consumer protections===

The administration reversed a [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) rule that had made it easier for aggrieved consumers to pursue [[class action]]s against banks; the Associated Press characterized the reversal as a victory for Wall Street banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/9121c1b1e4b543aeb9213a60182eb857|title=Consumers lose chance to sue banks in win for Wall Street|last=Sweet|first=Ken|date=October 25, 2017|website=AP NEWS|access-date=July 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mick Mulvaney's tenure, the CFPB reduced enforcement of rules that protected consumers from predatory [[Payday loan|payday lenders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-drops-investigation-of-high-cost-lender|title=Newly Defanged, Top Consumer Protection Agency Drops Investigation of High-Cost Lender|date=January 23, 2018|website=ProPublica|author=Paul Kiel|accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/8ed9d74512e646ff8449732930323240|title=Payday lenders, watchdog agency exhibit cozier relationship|accessdate=March 6, 2018|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump scrapped a proposed rule from the Obama administration that airlines disclose baggage fees.&lt;ref name=":48"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/363956-trump-admin-scraps-obama-era-proposal-requiring-airlines-to-disclose|title=Trump admin scraps Obama-era proposal requiring airlines to disclose bag fees|last=Zanona|first=Melanie|date=December 8, 2017|work=TheHill|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump reduced enforcement of regulations against airlines; fines levied by the administration in 2017 were less than half of what the Obama administration did the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/as-airline-rules-relax-under-trump-heres-a-survival-guide-to-flying-in-2018/2017/12/27/693795ee-e444-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html|title=Perspective {{!}} As airline rules relax under Trump, here's a survival guide to flying in 2018|last=Elliott|first=Christopher|date=December 28, 2017|work=Washington Post|accessdate=January 3, 2018|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal justice===

[[File:Ann Wagner Statement on President Signing FOSTA into Law.jpg|thumb|Trump signed new anti-sex-trafficking legislation on April 16, 2018.]]

In August 2017, Trump used an executive order to reverse a ban implemented by the Obama administration, thus allowing certain kinds of military equipment to be given to American police. That ban was one of the police reform policies implemented in the wake of 2014's [[Ferguson unrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Kevin |title=Trump lifts ban on military gear to local police forces |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/27/trump-expected-lift-ban-military-gear-local-police-forces/606065001/ |accessdate=June 17, 2020 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the Justice Department under the Trump administration stated that it would no longer investigate police departments and publicize their shortcomings in reports, a policy previously enacted under the Obama administration. These reports were the basis of negotiating "[[consent decrees]]", agreements for police reform between police departments and the Justice Department, which courts could enforce. These consent decrees were used by the Obama administration and the Trump administration. However, the Trump administration's first Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, publicly opposed consent decrees, and in November 2018, just before Sessions was fired by Trump, Sessions ordered for consent decrees to be severely restricted. Later in June 2020, Trump falsely claimed that the Obama administration never tried to reform the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Timm |first1=Jane |title=Trump says Obama didn't reform policing — but he did.

In November 2017, the ''New York Times'' summarized the Trump administration's "general approach to law enforcement" as "cracking down on violent crime", "not regulating the police departments that fight it", and overhauling "programs that the Obama administration used to ease tensions between communities and the police".&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/us/trump-justice-department-police.html|title=How Trump's Hands-Off Approach to Policing Is Frustrating Some Chiefs|last=Eder|first=Steve|date=November 21, 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 22, 2017|last2=Protess|first2=Ben|issn=0362-4331|last3=Dewan|first3=Shaila}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration reversed a 16-year old moratorium on federal [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] in 2019, with Attorney General Barr directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to schedule five executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ag-barr-orders-reinstatement-federal-death-penalty-n1034451|date=July 25, 2019|last1=Williams|first1=Pete|last2=Arkin|first2=Daniel|title=AG Barr orders reinstatement of the federal death penalty|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration reinstated the use of [[asset forfeiture]]—the practice of seizing the property of crime suspects who have not been charged with or convicted of a crime—making it so local authorities in the states that banned asset forfeiture could engage in the practice.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sessions-signals-more-police-property-seizures-coming-from-justice-department/|title=Sessions reinstates asset forfeiture policy at Justice Department|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a sheriff complained about a state senator who proposed legislation to end asset forfeiture, Trump responded, "Who is the state senator?

''The New York Times'' remarked that Trump took no action on more than ten thousand pending applications and that he used his pardon power solely on "public figures whose cases resonated with him given his own grievances with investigators".&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt;

====Drug policy====

{{Main|Cannabis policy of the Donald Trump administration}}

In a May 2017 departure from the Obama DOJ's policy to reduce long jail sentencing for minor drug offenses and contrary to a growing bipartisan consensus, the administration ordered federal prosecutors to seek maximum sentencing for [[Drug offence|drug offenses]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/us/politics/jeff-sessions-criminal-sentencing.html|title=Bipartisan View Was Emerging on Sentencing.

===Defense===

As a candidate and as president, Trump called for a major build-up of American military capabilities, including increasing the nuclear arsenal tenfold. He said he was open to allowing Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. He announced in October 2018 that America would withdraw from the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] with Russia to enable America to counter increasing Chinese intermediate nuclear missile capabilities in the Pacific. In December 2018, Trump complained about the amount America spends on an "uncontrollable arms race" with Russia and China. Trump said the $716 billion America is now spending on the "arms race" was "Crazy!", after praising his increased defense spending five months earlier. The total fiscal 2019 defense budget authorization was $716 billion, although missile defense and nuclear programs comprised about $10 billion of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/donald-trump-speech.html|title=Donald Trump Vows to Bolster Nation's Military Capacities|last1=Parker|first1=Ashley|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Matthew|date=September 7, 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|accessdate=December 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/world/middleeast/obama-nuclear-security-summit-iran.html|title=Obama Rebukes Donald Trump's Comments on Nuclear Weapons|last=Landler|first=Mark|date=April 1, 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|accessdate=December 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/russia-nuclear-arms-treaty-trump-administration.html|title=U.S. to Tell Russia It Is Leaving Landmark I.N.F.

&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2018, Trump falsely asserted he had secured the largest defense budget authorization ever, the first military pay raise in ten years, and that military spending was at least 4.0% of GDP, "which got a lot bigger since I became your president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3 False Claims From Trump's Naval Academy Speech|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/us/politics/fact-check-trump-naval-academy-speech.html|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy arose in November 2019 after Trump pardoned or promoted three soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announces-review-green-beret-murder-case-we-train-our-n1065421|title=Trump announces 'review' of Green Beret murder case: 'We train our boys to be killing machines'|website=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent case involved [[Eddie Gallagher (Navy SEAL)|Eddie Gallagher]], a Navy SEAL team chief who had been reported to Navy authorities by his own team members for [[sniper|sniping]] at an unarmed civilian girl and elderly man. Gallagher faced [[court martial]] for the murder of a wounded teenage combatant, among other charges, and the medic of his SEAL team was granted immunity to testify against him, but on the witness stand the medic reversed what he had previously told investigators and testified that he himself had murdered the terrorist suspect. Gallagher was subsequently acquitted of the murder charge against him, and the Navy demoted him to the lowest possible rank due to his conviction on another charge. The Navy later moved to strip Gallagher of his [[Special Warfare insignia|Trident pin]] and eject him from the Navy. Trump intervened to restore Gallagher's rank and pin. Many military officers were enraged by Trump's intervention, as they felt it disrupted principles of military discipline and justice. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Richard V. Spencer|Richard Spencer]] protested Trump's intervention and was forced to resign; in his resignation letter, he sharply rebuked Trump for his judgment in the matter. Trump told a rally audience days later, "I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/navy-seals-edward-gallagher-trident.html|title=Navy Wants to Eject From SEALs a Sailor Cleared by Trump, Officials Say|first=Dave|last=Philipps|date=November 19, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/trump-seals-eddie-gallagher.html|title=Trump Reverses Navy Decision to Oust Edward Gallagher From SEALs|first=Dave|last=Philipps|date=November 21, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/472201-trump-says-he-stood-up-to-the-deep-state-by-intervening-in-war-crime-cases|title=Trump says he stood up to the 'deep state' by intervening in war crime cases|first=Brett|last=Samuels|date=November 26, 2019|website=TheHill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump's economic policies have centered on cutting taxes, deregulation, and trade protectionism. His involvement has included the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], the cancellation of [[NAFTA]] and negotiation for [[USMCA]], and tariffs on China and the European Union.

One of Trump's first actions was to indefinitely suspend a cut in fee rates for federally-insured mortgages implemented by the Obama administration. The cut in fee rates would have saved individuals with lower credit scores around $500 per year on a typical loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-fha-rate-cut-explained-20170123-story.html|title=Trump's team suspended a mortgage insurance rate cut. Here's what that means|last=Khouri|first=Andrew|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the DOJ announced it would not defend in courts a mandate that would have extended overtime benefits to more than four million workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/349221-justice-department-drops-appeal-to-save-obama-overtime-rule|title=Justice Department drops appeal to save Obama overtime rule|last=Bowden|first=John|date=September 5, 2017|work=The Hill|access-date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known as food stamps, which if implemented would lead millions to lose access to food stamps and limit the size of food stamps for those who were still eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Trump's proposed SNAP changes could mean millions lose food stamp access|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-administration-proposal-could-cause-millions-lose-food-stamps-n1092866|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=December 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the administration proposed a tax overhaul, which became the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. The proposal was to reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% (from 35%) and eliminate the estate tax. On individual tax returns it would change the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12%, 25%, and 35%; apply a 25% tax rate to business income reported on a personal tax return; eliminate the [[alternative minimum tax]]; eliminate personal exemptions; double the standard deduction; and eliminate many itemized deductions (specifically retaining the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions).&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan-middle-class-deficit.html|title=Trump Proposes the Most Sweeping Tax Overhaul in Decades|last=Davis|first=Julie Hirschfeld|date=September 27, 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 27, 2017|last2=Rappeport|first2=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump appointed [[Betsy DeVos]] as his Secretary of Education. Her nomination was confirmed on a 50–50 Senate vote with Vice President Pence called upon to break the tie (the first time a vice president had cast a tie-breaking vote on a Cabinet nomination).&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Brown|title=With historic tiebreaker from Pence, DeVos confirmed as education secretary|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/senate-to-vote-today-on-confirmation-of-betsy-devos/2017/02/06/fd4b7e9c-ec85-11e6-9662-6eedf1627882_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post|date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats opposed DeVos as underqualified, while Republicans supported DeVos because of her strong support of [[school choice]].&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; DeVos became one of the more polarizing Trump Cabinet members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Binkley |first1=Collin |title=Polarizing but enduring Cabinet member: Education head DeVos |url=https://apnews.com/75bd4395846b456f9d0eba1279ab1cd6 |agency=Associated Press|date=May 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Trump revoked an Obama administration memo which provided protections for people in default on student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/03/17/trump-administration-rolls-back-protections-for-people-in-default-on-student-loans/|title=Trump administration rolls back protections for people in default on student loans|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Department cancelled agreements with the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) to police student loan fraud.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/349223-education-dept-ends-agreement-to-work-with-consumer-bureau-on-student-loan|title=DeVos ends agreement to work on student loan fraud|last=Lane|first=Sylvan|date=September 5, 2017|work=The Hill|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seth Frotman, the CFPB student loan ombudsman, resigned, accusing the Trump administration of undermining the CFPB's work on protecting student borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/27/642199524/student-loan-watchdog-quits-blames-trump-administration|title=Student Loan Watchdog Quits, Says Trump Administration 'Turned Its Back' On Borrowers|work=NPR|accessdate=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 DeVos said the Obama administration's guidance for how campuses address sexual assault "failed too many students" and she announced that she intended to replace the current approach "with a workable, effective and fair system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silva |first1=Daniella |title=Betsy DeVos to Overhaul Obama-Era Title IX Guidance on Campus Sex Assault |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/betsy-devos-overhaul-obama-era-guidance-campus-sex-assault-n799471 |website=NBC News |accessdate=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the administration scrapped an Obama administration guidance on how schools and universities should combat sexual harassment and sexual violence. DeVos criticized the guidance for undermining the rights of those accused of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/devos-colleges-sex-assault.html|title=Betsy DeVos Reverses Obama-era Policy on Campus Sexual Assault Investigations|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos marginalized an investigative unit within the Department of Education which under Obama investigated predatory activities by for-profit colleges. The unit had been scaled down from a dozen employees to three, and had been repurposed to process student loan forgiveness applications and focus on smaller compliance cases. An investigation started under Obama into the practices of DeVry Education Group, which operates for-profit colleges, was halted in early 2017, and the former dean at DeVry was made into the supervisor for the investigative unit later that summer. DeVry paid a $100 million fine in 2016 for defrauding students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/education-department-for-profit-colleges.html|title=Education Department Unwinds Unit Investigating Fraud at For-Profits|date=May 13, 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration rescinded a regulation restricting federal funding to for-profit colleges unable to demonstrate that college graduates had a reasonable debt-to-earnings ratio after entering the job market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/us/politics/betsy-devos-for-profit-colleges.html|title=DeVos Ends Obama-Era Safeguards Aimed at Abuses by For-Profit Colleges|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election integrity===

On the eve of the 2018 mid-term elections, ''Politico'' described the Trump administration's efforts to combat election propaganda as "rudderless". At the same time, U.S. intelligence agencies warned about "on-going campaigns" by Russia, China and Iran to influence American elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/31/2018-elections-security-disinformation-trump-administration-response-949703|title=Inside the Trump administration's rudderless fight to counter election propaganda|work=POLITICO|access-date=November 5, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration's "America First Energy Plan" did not mention renewable energy and instead focused on fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/business/energy-environment/trump-energy-plan-climate.html |title=Trump Got Nearly $1 Million in Energy-Efficiency Subsidies in 2012 |last=Tabuchi |first=Hiroko |date=March 3, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration enacted 30% tariffs on imported solar panels. The American solar energy industry is highly reliant on foreign parts (80% of parts are made abroad); as a result, the tariffs could raise the costs of solar energy, reduce innovation and reduce jobs in the industry—which in 2017 employed nearly four times as many American workers as the coal industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/trump-solar-tariffs.html|title=Trump's Solar Tariffs Are Clouding the Industry's Future|last=Swanson|first=Ana|date=2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 24, 2018|last2=Plumer|first2=Brad|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":59"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-22/trump-taxes-solar-imports-in-biggest-blow-to-clean-energy-yet|title=Trump's Solar Tariffs Mark Biggest Blow to Renewables Yet|date=January 22, 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration reversed standards put in place to make commonly used lightbulbs more energy-efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/09/04/757623821/trump-administration-reverses-standards-for-energy-efficient-light-bulbs|title=Trump Administration Reverses Standards For Energy-Efficient Lightbulbs|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=December 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the administration singled out the state of Florida as an exemption from the administration's offshore drilling plan. The move stirred controversy because it came after the Governor of Florida, Republican Rick Scott (who was considering a 2018 Senate run), complained about the offshore drilling plan. The move raised ethical questions because Trump owns a resort in Florida and because Florida is a swing state Trump would like to win in the 2020 presidential election. ''NBC News'' said the decision had the appearance of "transactional favoritism" and that it was likely to lead to lawsuits.&lt;ref name=":57"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-looks-he-s-playing-favorites-florida-offshore-relief-n836381|title=Trump looks like he's playing favorites with Florida offshore relief|work=NBC News|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of several [[mass shootings in the United States|mass shootings]] during the Trump administration, including [[2019 El Paso shooting|August 2019 shootings in El Paso, Texas]] and [[2019 Dayton shooting|Dayton, Ohio]], Trump called on states to implement [[red flag law]]s to remove guns from "those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety".&lt;ref name="Back"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/05/dayton-el-paso-shootings-what-red-flag-laws/1922428001/ | title = After back to back shootings, Trump called for red flag laws.

Although the U.S. government was initially quick to develop a diagnostic test for the coronavirus, U.S. [[COVID-19 testing]] efforts from mid-January to late-February lost pace compared to the rest of the world. South Korea and the United States had the first confirmed case on the same day, yet by mid-March, 290,000 people had been tested in South Korea (a country of approximately 50 million) whereas only 60,000 people had been tested in the U.S. (a country of approximately 330 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-testing-specialrep-idUSKBN2153BW|title=Special Report: How Korea trounced U.S. in race to test people for coronavirus|date=March 18, 2020|work=Reuters|access-date=March 19, 2020|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC News described the testing as "shockingly slow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-responsible-testing-problems-things/story?id=69590286|title=Trump says he's not responsible for testing problems: 3 things to know|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=March 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the WHO distributed 1.4 million coronavirus tests in February, the U.S. chose instead to use its own tests. At that time, the CDC had produced 160,000 coronavirus tests, but many were defective. As a result, fewer than 4,000 tests were done in the U.S. by February 27, with U.S. state laboratories conducting only about 200.

Trump signed into law $15 billion in relief for Harvey and Irma, and later $18.67 billion for all three.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greer|first=Scott L.|last2=Creary|first2=Melissa S.|last3=Singer|first3=Phillip M.|last4=Willison|first4=Charley E.|date=January 1, 2019|title=Quantifying inequities in US federal response to hurricane disaster in Texas and Florida compared with Puerto Rico|url=https://gh.bmj.com/content/4/1/e001191|journal=BMJ Global Health|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e001191|doi=10.1136/bmjgh-2018-001191|pmid=30775009|issn=2059-7908|pmc=6350743}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration came under criticism for its delayed response to the humanitarian crisis on Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-visit-hurricane-ravaged-puerto-rico-amid-criticism/story?id=50101038|title=Trump to visit hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, says he is 'very proud' of response |date=September 27, 2017|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians of both parties had called for immediate aid for Puerto Rico, and criticized Trump for focusing on a feud with the NFL instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/26/politics/trump-puerto-rico-response/index.html|title=Trump ramps up Puerto Rico response amid criticism|author=Jeremy Diamond |author2=Kevin Liptak|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump did not comment on Puerto Rico for several days while the crisis was unfolding.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-puerto-rico-atlantic-ocean-2017-9?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Trump addresses criticism over Puerto Rico disaster response: 'It's out in the ocean—you can't just drive your trucks there'|website=Business Insider|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Washington Post'', the White House did not feel a sense of urgency until "images of the utter destruction and desperation—and criticism of the administration's response—began to appear on television".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; Trump dismissed the criticism, saying distribution of necessary supplies was "doing well".

====California wildfires====

In November 2018, while California experienced [[2018 California wildfires|one of its most destructive wildfires]], Trump blamed the fires on "gross" and "poor" "mismanagement" of forests by California, saying there was no other reason for these wildfires. ''The New York Times'' described Trump's claims as misleading, noting that the fires in question were not "forest fires", that most of the forest was owned by federal agencies, and that climate change in part contributed to the fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/fact-check-trump-california-fire-tweet.html|title=Trump's Misleading Claims About California's Fire 'Mismanagement'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|department=Fact Check|first=Kendra |last=Pierre-Louis|date=November 12, 2018|access-date=November 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has repeatedly characterized [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] as criminals, although multiple studies have found they have lower crime and incarceration rates than native-born Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/us/politics/trump-immigration-borders-family-separation.html|title=Trump Highlights Immigrant Crime to Defend His Border Policy.

The transcript of a January 2017 phone call between Trump and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto was leaked; in the phone call, Trump conceded that he would fund the border wall, not by charging Mexico as he promised during the campaign, and implored the Mexican president to stop saying publicly the Mexican government would not pay for the border wall.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/you-cannot-say-that-to-the-press-trump-urged-mexican-president-to-end-his-public-defiance-on-border-wall-transcript-reveals/2017/08/03/0c2c0a4e-7610-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html|title=Trump urged Mexican president to end his public defiance on border wall, transcript reveals|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, the administration proposed spending $18 billion over the next ten years on the wall, more than half of the $33 billion spending blueprint for border security.&lt;ref name=":56"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/trump-border-wall-funding-surveillance.html|title=To Pay for Wall, Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures|last=Nixon|first=Ron|date=2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 9, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's plan would reduce funding for border surveillance, radar technology, patrol boats and customs agents; experts and officials say these are more effective at curbing illegal immigration and preventing terrorism and smuggling than a border wall.&lt;ref name=":56" /&gt;

The administration embraced the 2017 [[RAISE Act]], a proposal to reduce legal immigration levels to the U.S. by 50% by halving the number of [[Permanent residence (United States)|green cards]] issued, capping [[refugee]] admissions at 50,000 a year and ending the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa|visa diversity lottery]].&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/wharton-study-immigration-proposal-will-lead-to-less-economic-growth-and-fewer-jobs-20170810.html|title=Wharton study: Immigration proposal will lead to less economic growth and fewer jobs|work=Philadelphia Daily News|accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration terminated a program that granted temporary legal residence to unaccompanied Central American minors. 2,714 individuals would need to renew their legal residence status through other more difficult immigrant channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-ends-obama-era-protection-program-for-central-american-minors/2017/08/16/8101507e-82b6-11e7-ab27-1a21a8e006ab_story.html|title=Trump administration ends Obama-era protection program for Central American minors|first1=David|last1=Nakamura|work=The Washington Post|date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration revoked the [[Temporary Protected Status]] (TPS) granted to 60,000 Haitians (following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]),&lt;ref name=":55"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-to-end-provisional-residency-for-200000-salvadorans/2018/01/08/badfde90-f481-11e7-beb6-c8d48830c54d_story.html|title=200,000 Salvadorans may be forced to leave the U.S. as Trump ends immigration protection|last=Miroff|first=Nick|date=January 8, 2018|work=Washington Post|accessdate=January 8, 2018|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 200,000 Salvadorans (following a series of devastating earthquakes in 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/salvadorans-tps-end.html|title=Trump Administration Says That Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans Must Leave|last=Jordan|first=Miriam|date=2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 8, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salvadorans are parents to an estimated 190,000 U.S.-born children.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; A federal judge blocked the administration's attempt to deport the TPS recipients, citing what the judge said was Trump's racial "animus against non-white, non-European immigrants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/10/03/judge-blocks-trump-administration-deporting-immigrants-under-tps/1517268002/|title=Federal judge blocks Trump from deporting hundreds of thousands of immigrants under TPS|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis released by Trump's [[Department of Health and Human Services]] in September 2017 was found to have removed earlier findings that refugees entering America had a $63 billion net positive effect on tax revenues between 2005 and 2014, with the final report counting only the costs refugees incur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/refugees-revenue-cost-report-trump.html|title=Trump Administration Rejects Study Showing Positive Impact of Refugees|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, Sessions rescinded a DOJ guidance on refugees and asylum seekers' right to work, thus prohibiting them from working in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/regulation/international/395440-sessions-rescinds-guidance-on-refugees-asylum-seekers-right-to-work|title=Sessions rescinds DOJ guidance on refugees, asylum seekers' right to work|last=Thomsen|first=Jacqueline|date=July 3, 2018|work=TheHill|accessdate=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Secretary of Defense Mattis added additional background checks for non-citizens who served in the military and extended the time they had to serve before they could receive necessary paperwork to pursue U.S. citizenship. As a result of these changes, the number of service members who applied for citizenship through their service declined by 65% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/05/03/naturalizations-drop-65-percent-for-service-members-seeking-citizenship-after-mattis-memo|title=Naturalizations drop 65 percent for service members seeking citizenship after Mattis memo|last=Copp|first=Tara|date=May 3, 2018|work=Military Times|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the administration announced that it would make it illegal for spouses of [[H-1B visa]] holders to work in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/15/technology/h1b-visa-spouses-h4-trump/index.html?iid=hp-stack-dom|title=Trump will stop spouses of H-1B visa holders from working|last=Mullen|first=Jethro|work=CNNMoney|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Trump was widely criticized after referring to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations in general as "shithole countries" at a bipartisan meeting on immigration. Multiple international leaders condemned his remarks as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/african-nations-slam-trump-s-vulgar-remarks-reprehensible-racist-n837486|title=African nations slam Trump's vulgar remarks as "racist"|work=NBC News|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 2018, arrests of undocumented immigrants by ICE increased by 40% during Trump's tenure. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants were twice as high as during Obama's final year in office.

In March 2018, the Commerce Department announced it would add a citizenship question to the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]].

In 2018, experts noted that the Trump administration's immigration policies had led to an increase in criminality and lawlessness along the U.S.–Mexico border, as asylum seekers prevented by U.S. authorities from filing for asylum had been preyed upon by human smugglers, organized crime and corrupt local law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/19/americas/trump-migration-border-smuggling/index.html|title=Trump's immigration policies were supposed to make the border safer.

Parents were routinely charged with a [[misdemeanor]] and jailed; their children were placed in separate detention centers with no established procedure to track them or reunite them with their parent after they had served time for their offence, generally only a few hours or days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jarrett |first1=Laura |title=Federal judge orders reunification of parents and children, end to most family separations at border |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/federal-court-order-family-separations/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Trump falsely accused Democrats of creating that policy, despite it originating from his own administration, and urged Congress to "get together" and pass an immigration bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/trump-immigrant-children-lost.html|title=Did the Trump Administration Separate Immigrant Children From Parents and Lose Them?|date=May 28, 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Congress from both parties condemned the practice and pointed out that the White House could end the separations on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/6/19/17478350/republicans-family-separations-trump-midterms|title=Republicans are starting to worry that voters will punish them for family separations|last=Zhou|first=Li|date=June 19, 2018|work=Vox|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' quoted a White House official as saying Trump's decision to separate migrant families was to gain political leverage to force Democrats and moderate Republicans to accept hardline immigration legislation.&lt;ref name=":78"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scherer |first1=Michael |last2=Dawsey |first2=Josh |title=Trump cites as a negotiating tool his policy of separating immigrant children from their parents |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-cites-as-a-negotiating-tool-his-policy-of-separating-immigrant-children-from-their-parents/2018/06/15/ade82b80-70b3-11e8-bf86-a2351b5ece99_story.html?noredirect=on |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Trump signed an [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] which indefinitely suspended admission of asylum seekers fleeing the [[Syrian Civil War]], suspended admission of all other refugees for 120 days, and denied entry to citizens of [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]] and [[Yemen]] for 90 days.

In June, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] partially [[Stay of execution|stayed]] certain injunctions that were put on the order by two federal appeals courts earlier, allowing the executive order to mostly go into effect.

The administration marginalized the role of science in policymaking, halted numerous research projects, and saw the departure of scientists who said their work was marginalized or suppressed.&lt;ref name=":61" /&gt; It was the first administration since 1941 not to name a [[Science Advisor to the President]].

The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] prohibited the use of the term "[[climate change]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/energy-department-climate-change-phrases-banned-236655|title=Energy Department climate office bans use of phrase 'climate change'|work=POLITICO|access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration reportedly sent a list to the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] on words that the agency was prohibited from using in its official communications, including "[[transgender]]", "[[fetus]]", "[[Evidence-based research|evidence-based]]", "science-based", "[[Vulnerability|vulnerable]]", "[[entitlement]]", and "[[Diversity (politics)|diversity]]".&lt;ref name=":49"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html|title=CDC gets list of forbidden words: fetus, transgender, diversity|last=Sun|first=Lena H.|date=December 15, 2017|work=Washington Post|accessdate=December 16, 2017|last2=Eilperin|first2=Juliet|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director of the CDC denied these reports.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/cdc-director-says-there-are-no-banned-words-at-the-agency|title=CDC director says there are 'no banned words' at the agency |work=PBS|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2020 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that an official at the Interior Department has repeatedly inserted climate change-denying language into the agency's scientific reports, such as those that affect water and mineral rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/climate/goks-uncertainty-language-interior.html|title=A Trump Insider Embeds Climate Denial in Scientific Research|last=Tabuchi|first=Hiroko|date=March 2, 2020|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveillance===

In 2019, Trump signed into law a six-year extension of Section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA), allowing the NSA to conduct searches of foreigners' communications without any warrant. The process incidentally collects information from Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Volz |first1=Dustin |title=Trump signs bill renewing NSA's internet surveillance program |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cyber-surveillance/trump-signs-bill-renewing-nsas-internet-surveillance-program-idUSKBN1F82MK |website=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=June 27, 2019 |date=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veterans affairs===

Prior to [[David Shulkin]]'s firing in April 2018, ''The New York Times'' described the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) as a "rare spot of calm in the Trump administration". Shulkin built upon changes started under the Obama administration to do a long-term overhaul of the VA system.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/va-medical-system-chaos.html|title=V.A.

In August 2018, ''ProPublica'' reported a group of three wealthy Mar-a-Lago patrons, who had no experience in the military or the government, formed an "informal council" that strongly shaped VA decision-making, including involving a $10 billion contract to modernize veterans' health records. The trio, which VA staff referred to as "the [[Mar-a-Lago Crowd]]", spoke to VA staff daily, and provided instructions on policy and personnel decisions at the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/ike-perlmutter-bruce-moskowitz-marc-sherman-shadow-rulers-of-the-va|title=The Shadow Rulers of the VA|last=Arnsdorf|first=Isaac|date=August 7, 2018|website=ProPublica|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] announced in November 2018 that it would investigate the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/26/mar-a-lago-trump-investigation-va-contracts-1015803|title=Watchdog office to probe Mar-a-Lago members' influence at VA|publisher=[[Politico]]|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting rights===

Under the first 18 months of the administration, the DOJ "launched no new efforts to roll back state restrictions on the ability to vote, and instead often sides with them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/us/voting-rights-voter-id-suppression.html|title=Voting Rights Advocates Used to Have an Ally in the Government.

Trump repeatedly, without evidence, alleged there was widespread voter fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/09/666018707/trump-scott-spread-claims-of-voter-fraud-as-florida-race-narrows|title=As Florida Races Narrow, Trump And Scott Spread Claims Of Fraud Without Evidence|work=NPR.org|access-date=November 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration created a [[Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity|commission]] with the stated purpose to review the extent of voter fraud in the wake of Trump's false claim that millions of unauthorized votes cost him the popular vote in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. It was chaired by Vice President Pence, while the day-to-day administrator was [[Kris Kobach]], best known for promoting restrictions on access to voting. The commission began its work by requesting each state to turn over detailed information about all registered voters in their database. Most states rejected the request, citing privacy concerns or state laws.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news| author1= Liz Stark| author2=Grace Hauck| date= July 5, 2017| publisher= CNN| url= http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/03/politics/kris-kobach-letter-voter-fraud-commission-information/index.html| title= Forty-four states and DC have refused to give certain voter information to Trump commission| accessdate= July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple lawsuits were filed against the commission. [[Maine Secretary of State]] [[Matthew Dunlap]] said Kobach was refusing to share working documents and scheduling information with him and the other Democrats on the commission. A federal judge ordered the commission to hand over the documents.&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2018/01/06/trump-administration-resists-turning-over-documents-to-dunlap/|title=Trump refuses to release documents to Maine secretary of state despite judge's order|date=January 6, 2018|work=Portland Press Herald|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Trump disbanded the commission, and informed Dunlap that it would not obey the court order to provide the documents because the commission no longer existed.&lt;ref name=":51"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html|title=Trump Disbands Commission on Voter Fraud|last=Haag|first=Matthew|date=2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 4, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Election integrity experts argued that the commission was disbanded because of the lawsuits, which would have led to greater transparency and accountability and thus prevented the Republican members of the commission from producing a sham report to justify restrictions on voting rights.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; It was later revealed the Commission had, in its requests for Texas voter data, specifically asked for data that identifies voters with Hispanic surnames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/trump-election-fraud-commission-bought-texas-election-data-flagging-hispanic-voters/2018/01/22/2791934a-fd55-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html|title=Trump voting commission bought Texas election data flagging Hispanic voters|last=Hsu|first=Spencer S.|date=January 22, 2018|work=Washington Post|accessdate=January 22, 2018|last2=Wagner|first2=John|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2017, Trump condemned violence "on many sides" after [[2017 Unite the Right rally|a gathering]] of hundreds of [[White nationalism|white nationalists]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], the previous day (August 12) turned deadly.

Bolton]], reportedly "scrambled to keep American strategy on track without mention of a withdrawal that would drastically reduce Washington's influence in Europe and could embolden Russia for decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html|title=Trump Discussed Pulling U.S. From NATO, Aides Say Amid New Concerns Over Russia|first1=Julian E.|last1=Barnes|first2=Helene|last2=Cooper|date=January 14, 2019|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2019 intelligence community assessment found that Iran was not pursuing nuclear weapons and North Korea was unlikely to relinquish its nuclear arsenal. Both assessments directly contradicted core tenets of Trump's stated foreign policy. The [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] also assessed that Trump's trade policies and unilateralism had damaged traditional alliances and induced foreign partners to seek new relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/us/politics/intelligence-chiefs-senate-threats-.html|title=U.S. Intelligence Chiefs Contradict Trump on North Korea and Iran|first1=David E.|last1=Sanger|first2=Julian E.|last2=Barnes|date=January 29, 2019|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the heads of the intelligence community presented their findings in public testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Trump referred to them as "extremely passive and naive" and "wrong" in their assessments. The following day, Trump asserted the press had misquoted the intelligence chiefs' testimony to fabricate a conflict, claiming that he and the intelligence community were "on the same page!" In a subsequent interview with ''The New York Times'', Trump falsely asserted that the intelligence community had characterized Iran as "essentially, a wonderful place".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/intelligence-officials-were-misquoted-after-public-hearing-trump-claims/2019/01/31/339952ce-25a7-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html|title=Intelligence officials were 'misquoted' after public hearing, Trump claims|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-interview.html|title=What Do You Learn About Trump in an 85-Minute Interview?|first1=Peter|last1=Baker|first2=Maggie|last2=Haberman|date=February 1, 2019|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, former Trump campaign advisor [[George Papadopoulos]] pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to the FBI regarding his contacts with Russian agents. During the campaign he had tried repeatedly but unsuccessfully to set up meetings in Russia between Trump campaign representatives and Russian officials. The guilty plea was part of a plea bargain whereby Papadopoulos cooperates with the Mueller investigation.&lt;ref name=NYTGuilty&gt;{{cite news |first1=Matt |last1=Apuzzo | first2= Michael S. |last2=Schmidt |authorlink1=Matt Apuzzo |authorlink2=Michael S.

I, p. 4: At the same time the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas "DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0". The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.&lt;/ref&gt; To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators used the legal standard for criminal [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] rather than the popular concept of "collusion", because a crime of "collusion" is not found in criminal law or the [[United States Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of "collusion". In so doing, the Office recognized that the word "collud[e]" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, the investigation "identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign", and found that Russia "perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency" and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign "expected it would benefit electorally" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, "the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."&lt;ref name="GlobeGraphic"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ostriker |first1=Rebecca |last2=Puzzanghera |first2=Jim |last3=Finucane |first3=Martin |last4=Datar |first4=Saurabh |last5=Uraizee |first5=Irfan |last6=Garvin |first6=Patrick |title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more |url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/ |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIMErelease"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Law |first1=Tara |title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report |url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony (exercising the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]), as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to "[[drain the swamp]]"—a phrase that usually refers to entrenched corruption and lobbying in Washington, D.C.—and he proposed a series of ethics reforms.&lt;ref name="bschrekinger11182016"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-proposes-ethics-reform-229911|title=Trump proposes ethics reforms|date=October 17, 2016|newspaper=Politico|last1=Schrekinger|first1=Ben|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to federal records and interviews, there has been a dramatic increase in lobbying by corporations and hired interests during Trump's tenure, particularly through the office of Vice-President Mike Pence.&lt;ref name=wapopence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-turns-vps-office-into-gateway-for-lobbyists-to-influence-the-trump-administration/2018/06/14/75675bfa-6424-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html|title=Pence turns VP's office into gateway for lobbyists to influence the Trump administration|first1=Michael|last1=Scherer|first2=Josh|last2=Dawsey|first3=Anu|last3=Narayanswamy|date=June 15, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About twice as many lobbying firms contacted Pence, compared to previous presidencies, among them representatives of major energy firms and drug companies.&lt;ref name=wapopence/&gt; In many cases, the lobbyists have charged their clients millions of dollars for access to the vice president, and then have turned around and donated the money to Pence's political causes.&lt;ref name=wapopence/&gt;

Among his proposals was a five-year ban on serving as a lobbyist after working in the executive branch.&lt;ref name="bschrekinger11182016" /&gt; Trump's transition team also announced that registered lobbyists would be barred from serving in the Trump administration.&lt;ref name="cho18november2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/11/16/trump-administration-will-ban-lobbyists-enact-five-year-lobbying-ban-after-leaving-government/|title=Trump administration will ban lobbyists, enact five-year lobbying ban after leaving government|date=November 16, 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|last1=Ho|first1=Catherine|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Obama era ban on lobbyists taking administrative jobs was lifted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gidda|first1=Mirren|title=Trump Transition Team Members Turn to Lobbying, Despite Six-month Ban|url=http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-lobbying-drain-swamp-transition-team-michael-flynn-594026|accessdate=May 20, 2017|work=Newsweek|date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least nine transition officials became lobbyists within the first 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump transition staffers head to K Street despite lobbying ban|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/03/trump-lobbying-ban-transition-237850|accessdate=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Trump's campaign promises was that he would not accept a presidential salary. In keeping with this pledge, Trump donated the entirety of his first two quarterly salaries as president to government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1341/take-no-salary/|title=Trump-O-Meter: Take no salary|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential conflicts of interest===

Trump's presidency has been marked by significant public concern about [[conflict of interest]] stemming from his diverse business ventures. In the lead up to his inauguration, Trump promised to remove himself from the day-to-day operations of his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html|title=Donald Trump's News Conference: Full Transcript and Video|date=January 11, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump placed his sons [[Eric Trump]] and [[Donald Trump Jr.]] at the head of his businesses claiming they would not communicate with him regarding his interests. However, critics noted that this would not prevent him from having input into his businesses and knowing how to benefit himself, and Trump continued to receive quarterly updates on his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/24/eric-trump-business-conflicts-of-interest|title=Eric Trump says he will keep father updated on business despite 'pact'|first=Alan|last=Yuhas|date=March 24, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his presidency progressed, he failed to take steps or show interest in further distancing himself from his business interests resulting in numerous potential conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interests/508382/|title=Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet|first=Jeremy|last=Venook|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ethics experts found Trump's plan to address conflicts of interest between his position as president and his private business interests to be entirely inadequate; [[Norman L. Eisen]] and [[Richard Painter]], who served as the chief White House ethics lawyers for Barack Obama and [[George W. Bush]] respectively, said the plan "falls short in every respect".&lt;ref name="YourishBuchanan"&gt;Karen Yourish &amp; Larry Buchanan, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/12/us/politics/ethics-experts-trumps-conflicts-of-interest.html It 'Falls Short in Every Respect': Ethics Experts Pan Trump's Conflicts Plan], ''The New York Times'' (January 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike every other president in the last 40 years, Trump did not put his business interests in a [[blind trust]] or equivalent arrangement "to cleanly sever himself from his business interests". Eisen said Trump's case is "an even more problematic situation because he's receiving foreign government payments and other benefits and things of value that's expressly prohibited by the Constitution" in the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]].&lt;ref name="YourishBuchanan" /&gt;

In January 2018, a year into his presidency, a survey found that he "continues to own stakes in hundreds of businesses, both in this country and abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump Ethics Monitor: Has The President Kept His Promises?|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/17/513724796/trump-ethics-monitor-has-the-president-kept-his-promises|publisher=NPR|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency and data availability===

''The Washington Post'' reported in May 2017, "a wide variety of information that until recently was provided to the public, limiting access, for instance, to disclosures about workplace violations, energy efficiency, and animal welfare abuses" had been removed or tucked away. The Obama administration had used the publication of enforcement actions taken by federal agencies against companies as a way to name and shame companies that engaged in unethical and illegal behaviors.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/under-trump-inconvenient-data-is-being-sidelined/2017/05/14/3ae22c28-3106-11e7-8674-437ddb6e813e_story.html|title=Under Trump, inconvenient data is being sidelined|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trump administration stopped the Obama administration policy of logging visitors to the White House, making it difficult to tell who has visited the White House.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-on-taxes-and-visitor-logs-white-house-1492471167-htmlstory.html|title=On taxes and visitor logs, White House grapples with transparency questions|last=Memoli|first=Michael A.|date=April 17, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Cortez of the [[Southern Methodist University]]'s [[Dedman School of Law]], who studies the handling of public data, said the Trump administration, unlike the Obama administration, was taking transparency "in the opposite direction".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Cost of trips===

According to several reports, Trump's and his family's trips in the first month of his presidency cost U.S. taxpayers nearly as much as former president Obama's travel expenses for an entire year. When Obama was president, Trump frequently criticized him for taking vacations which were paid for with public funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-costs-trips-security-taxpayer-barack-obama-month-year-a7586261.html|title=In a month, the Trump family has cost taxpayers almost as much as the Obamas did in a year|date=February 17, 2017 |newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported that Trump's atypically lavish lifestyle is far more expensive to the taxpayers than what was typical of former presidents and could end up in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the whole of Trump's term.&lt;ref name="trump family travels"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-familys-elaborate-lifestyle-a-logistical-nightmare--at-taxpayer-expense/2017/02/16/763cce8e-f2ce-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html|title=Trump family's elaborate lifestyle is a 'logistical nightmare'—at taxpayer expense|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2019 analysis by the ''Washington Post'' found that federal officials and GOP campaigns had spent at least $1.6 million at businesses owned by Trump during his presidency.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/when-trump-visits-his-clubs-government-agencies-and-republicans-pay-to-be-where-he-is/2019/06/20/a4c13c36-8ed0-11e9-adf3-f70f78c156e8_story.html|title=When Trump visits his clubs, government agencies and Republicans pay to be where he is|last=|first=|date=2019|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an undercount, as most of the data on spending by government officials covered only the first few months of Trump's presidency.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

===Security clearances===

In March 2019, [[Tricia Newbold]], a White House employee working on security clearances, spoke privately to the [[House Oversight Committee]], claiming that at least 25 [[Trump administration]] officials had been granted security clearances over the objections of career staffers. Newbold also asserted that some of these officials had previously had their applications rejected for "disqualifying issues", only for those rejections to be overturned with inadequate explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-panel-interviews-whistleblower-tricia-newbold-about-white-house-security-clearances/ |title=Whistleblower says 25 people given White House clearance despite rejections |last=Kaplan |first=Rebecca |date=April 1, 2019 |work=CBS News |access-date=April 3, 2019 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-whistleblower-says-she-felt-humiliated-after-retaliation-boss-n990171 |title=White House whistleblower says she felt humiliated after retaliation from boss |last=Strickler |first=Laura |date=April 2, 2019 |work=NBC News |access-date=April 3, 2019 |last2=Alexander |first2=Peter |language=en |last3=Schapiro |first3=Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/us/politics/tricia-newbold-whistle-blower-white-house.html |title=White House Whistle-Blower Did the Unexpected: She Returned to Work |last=Rogers |first=Katie |date=April 1, 2019 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 3, 2019 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accepting political information from foreign powers===

On June 12, 2019, Trump asserted he saw nothing wrong in accepting intelligence on his political adversaries from foreign powers, such as Russia, and he could see no reason to contact the FBI about it. Responding to a reporter who told him FBI director [[Christopher A. Wray|Christopher Wray]] had said such activities should be reported to the FBI, Trump said, "the FBI director is wrong." Trump elaborated, "there's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, 'we have information on your opponent'—oh, I think I'd want to hear it." Both Democrats and Republicans repudiated the remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/trump-russia-fbi.html|title=Trump Says 'I'd Take It' if Russia Again Offered Dirt on Opponent|first=Peter|last=Baker|date=June 12, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/us/politics/trump-russia-campaign-help.html|title=Trump Assailed for Saying He Would Take Campaign Help From Russia|first1=Peter|last1=Baker|first2=Nicholas|last2=Fandos|date=June 13, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/2ICl0Jw|title=Republicans lash Trump for being open to foreign oppo|first1=Burgess|last1=Everett|first2=Marianne|last2=Levine|website=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/absolutely-unprecedented-trump-upends-long-held-views-with-openness-to-foreign-assistance/2019/06/13/13f94f66-8df6-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html|title='Absolutely unprecedented': Trump upends long-held views with openness to foreign assistance|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impeachment inquiry===

{{main|Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump}}
{{see also|Trump–Ukraine scandal}}

On August 12, 2019, an unnamed intelligence official privately filed a whistleblower complaint with [[Michael Atkinson (Inspector General)|Michael Atkinson]], the [[Inspector General of the Intelligence Community]] (ICIG), under the provisions of the [[Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act]] (ICWPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Esteban |first1=Chiqui |last2=Rabinowitz |first2=Kate |last3=Meko |first3=Tim |last4=Uhrmacher |first4=Kevin |title=Who's who in the whistleblower complaint |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/27/whos-who-whistleblower-complaint/ |accessdate=October 1, 2019 |date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whistleblower alleged that President Trump had abused his office in soliciting foreign interference to improve his own electoral chances in 2020. The complaint reports that in a July 2019 call, Trump had asked Ukrainian president [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] to investigate potential 2020 rival presidential candidate [[Joe Biden]] and his son [[Hunter Biden]], as well as matters pertaining to whether Russian interference occurred in the 2016 U.S. election with regard to Democratic National Committee servers and the company Crowdstrike. Trump allegedly nominated his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to work with Ukraine on these matters. Additionally, the whistleblower alleged that the White House attempted to "lock down" the call records in a cover-up, and that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Giuliani and the Trump administration to urge Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The whistleblower posits that the pressure campaign may have included Trump cancelling Vice President Mike Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip, and Trump withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019.&lt;ref name=transcom&gt;{{cite news |last1=Korte |first1=Gregory |title=The Whistle-Blower Complaint Against Trump, Annotated |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-trump-ukraine-whistleblower-complaint-transcript/ |accessdate=October 1, 2019 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.apnews.com/cdd0d1da48e045c39c383d589ad919f6 |title=6 takeaways from the whistleblower complaint, including Rudy Giuliani's central role |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 27, 2019 |accessdate=October 1, 2019 |first=Michael |last=Balsamo |first2=Colleen |last2=Long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/politics/whistleblower-complaint-released/index.html |title=Whistleblower says White House tried to cover up Trump's abuse of power |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=September 26, 2019 |access-date=September 26, 2019 |first1=Marshall |last1=Cohen |first2=Katelyn |last2=Polantz |first3=David |last3=Shortell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Olorunnipa |first1=Toluse |last2=Parker |first2=Ashley |title=Pence seeks to dodge impeachment spotlight as his Ukrainian moves attract notice |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-seeks-to-dodge-impeachment-spotlight-as-his-ukrainian-moves-attract-notice/2019/09/26/d397bdea-e07a-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html |accessdate=October 1, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspector General Atkinson found the whistleblower's complaint both urgent and credible, so he transmitted the complaint on August 26 to [[Joseph Maguire]], the acting [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI). Under the law, Maguire was supposed to forward the complaint to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees within a week. Maguire refused, so Atkinson informed the congressional committees of the existence of the complaint, but not its content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kiely |first1=Eugene |last2=Roberston |first2=Lori |last3=Gore |first3=D'Angelo |title=The Whistleblower Complaint Timeline |url=https://www.factcheck.org/2019/09/the-whistleblower-complaint-timeline/ |accessdate=October 1, 2019 |work=[[Factcheck.org]] |date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapotut"/&gt; The general counsel for Maguire's office said that since the complaint was not about someone in the intelligence community, it was not an "urgent concern" and thus there was no need to pass it to Congress.

===Historians and political scientists===

Political scientist [[Norman Ornstein]] says many writers have tried to put Trump in perspective:
:Among President Trump's major accomplishments is the booming industry in books about him, his administration, the state of democracy in America, the rise of autocracy in America and abroad, the reasons for his rise, the bases of his support, the state of the Republican Party, the state of his mental health or lack thereof, the chaos in his White House and so on.
:Not all are strictly about Trump—the fact is the conditions and dynamics that brought us Trump long preceded him, and the changes in the fabric of our Republic are paralleled by changes in other longstanding democracies around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Ornstein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/books/review/alan-wolfe-politics-petulance-lawrence-lessig-america-compromised.html "Two Leading Intellectuals Analyze What Ails America" ''New York Times'' Dec. 7, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Democratic backsliding====

{{main|Democratic backsliding}}

Since the beginning of the presidency of Donald Trump, ratings of the well-functioning of U.S. democracy sharply plunged.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/3f/19/3f19efc9-e25f-4356-b159-b5c0ec894115/v-dem_democracy_report_2018.pdf|title=Democracy for All?

According to the 2018 ''[[V-DEM|Varieties of Democracy]]'' Annual Democracy Report, there has been "a significant [[democratic backsliding]] in the United States [since the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump]]]{{nbsp}}... attributable to weakening constraints on the executive".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Independent assessments by ''[[Freedom House]]'' and ''[[Bright Line Watch]]'' found a similar significant decline in overall democratic functioning.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/united-states|title=Freedom in the World 2018 {{!}} United States|last=|date=January 16, 2018|website=[[Freedom House]]|access-date=February 20, 2019|quote=Newly elected president Donald Trump, who took office in January, defied ethical standards observed by his recent predecessors, for instance by retaining and promoting his private business empire while in office, naming his daughter and son-in-law as presidential advisers, and refusing to divulge his tax records.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brightlinewatch.org/wave7/|title=Bright Line Watch: Wave VII|last=|date=November 15, 2018|website=[[Bright Line Watch]]|access-date=February 20, 2019|quote=The trajectories sketched by V-Dem and by the Bright Line Watch experts are remarkably consistent over time, though the Bright Line Watch assessments are a bit more tempered (slightly higher than V-Dem from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th, slightly lower since). Notably, both indices drop sharply in the last few years of the series. V-Dem's data end in 2017 but Bright Line Watch experts perceive further decline in 2018 (from 76 in 2015 to 69 in 2017 to 64 now). We interpret this decline as a response to the events of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Trump presidency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical rankings====

{{main|Historical rankings of presidents of the United States}}

[[BBC News]] wrote, in January 2019:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-46895634|title=How Will History Judge President Trump?|last=Bryant|first=Nick|date=January 17, 2019|work=[[BBC News]]|url-status=live|access-date=October 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the midpoint of Trump's first term, historians have struggled to detect the kind of virtues that offset his predecessors' vices: the infectious optimism of Reagan; the inspirational rhetoric of JFK; the legislative smarts of LBJ; or the governing pragmatism of Nixon. So rather than being viewed as the reincarnation of [[Ronald Reagan]] or [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], Trump gets cast as a modern-day [[James Buchanan]], [[Franklin Pierce]] or [[William Henry Harrison|William Harrison]]. Last year, a poll of nearly 200 political science scholars, which has routinely placed Republicans higher than Democrats, ranked him 44th out of the 44 men who have occupied the post.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2018 poll—as referenced, in 2019, by the BBC—was administered by the [[American Political Science Association]] (APSA) among political scientists specializing in the American presidency, and had ranked Trump in last place.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html |title=How Does Trump Stack Up Against the Best—and Worst—Presidents?|last=Rottinghaus|first=Brandon|date=February 19, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 20, 2019|last2=Vaughn|first2=Justin S.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican survey respondents rated him 40th out of 44th, Independents/Other respondents rated him 43rd out of 44th, while Democratic historians rated him 44th out of 44th.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; [[Siena College Research Institute]]'s 6th presidential expert poll, released in February 2019, placed Donald Trump 42nd out of 44th—ahead of [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[James Buchanan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Siena's 6th Presidential Expert Poll 1982–2018 |url=https://scri.siena.edu/2019/02/13/sienas-6th-presidential-expert-poll-1982-2018/ |publisher=[[Siena College Research Institute]] |date=February 13, 2019 |access-date=February 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{conservatism US}}
'''Trumpism''' is a concept  referring to the [[political ideology]] and style of government of [[Donald Trump]], and more generally, right-wing conservative-neonationalist or national-populist movements and their rhetoric in western democracies.&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trumpism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
The term came up during the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign]]. It denotes a [[populism|populist]] political method that suggests simple answers to complex political, economic and social problems and is intended to mobilise the losers of the growing [[social inequality|social inequality]], with contempt for the established political establishment. Ideologically, it has a right-wing conservative-nationalist accent,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Johannes Kuhn: [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/1.3648311 ''Who moved America to the right''], in: ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', 2 September 2017; Adam Serwer: [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-nationalists-delusion/546356/ ''The Nationalist's Delusion''], in: ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 20 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby Trump's political style also shows traits of [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Drutman, Larry Diamond, Joe Goldman: [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/opinion/trump-republicans-authoritarianism.html ''Is Trump Giving Authoritarianism a Bad Name?''], in: ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 March 2018; Greg Sargent: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/10/26/the-trump-authoritarian-cult/ ''The Trump authoritarian cult''], in: ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 26 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
In terms of foreign policy (in the sense of Trump’s ''[[America First (policy)|America First]]''), a [[unilateralism|unilateral]] is preferred to multilateral policy and national interests are particularly emphasized, also in the context of economic treaties and alliance obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rudolf: [https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/aktuell/2017A10_rdf.pdf ''US foreign policy under President Trump''], Stiftung für Wissenschaft und Politik; Thomas Assheuer: [https://www.zeit.de/2018/21/donald-trump-weltordnung-claremont-philosophie-leo-strauss/komplettansicht ''Donald Trump: Das Recht bin ich''], in: Zeit-Online, May 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Repeatedly Trump has shown a disdain for Canada as well as the transatlantic partners ([[NATO]] and [[European Union]]), who have been considered the most important allies of the United States so far. &lt;ref&gt;Julianne Smith, Jim Townsend: [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2018-07-09/nato-age-trump ''NATO in the Age of Trump''], in: ''Foreign Affairs'', 9 July 2018; Ishaan Tharoor: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/11/trumps-nato-trip-shows-america-first-is-america-alone/ ''Trump's NATO trip shows 'America First' is 'America Alone'''], in: ''The Washington Post'', 11. July 11, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt; Another characteristic of foreign policy is a sympathy for [[autocratic]] rulers, especially for the Russian president [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin|Vladimir Putin]], whom Trump often praised even before taking office&lt;ref&gt;[https://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/28/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-quotes/ Timeline: Donald Trump's praise for Vladimir Putin]&lt;/ref&gt; and during the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/gipfel-reaktionen-trumps-partei-mault-und-bleibt-folgsam-1.4057834 Trump and Putin: Republicans offer light criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of economic policy, Trumpism promises new jobs and more domestic investment.&lt;ref&gt;John Harwood: [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/opinion/why-trumpism-may-not-endure.html ''Why Trumpism May Not Endure.''] In: ''The New York Times'', January 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's hard line against export surpluses of American trading partners has led to a tense situation in 2018 with mutually imposed punitive tariffs between the US on the one hand and the EU and China on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Partington: [https://www.theguardian. com/business/2018/jul/07/trump-trade-war-china-us-products ''Trump's trade was: what is it and which products are affected?''], in: ''[[The Guardian]]', July 7, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Trump secures the support of his political base, which is dissatisfied with the development in the USA so far, with a policy that strongly emphasizes nationalism, anti-elitism and criticism of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Thompson: ''Understanding Trumpism: The foreign policy of the new American president.'' In: ''Sirius - Journal of Strategic Analysis'', issue 1(2), 2017, pp. 109-115 ([https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/sirius.2017.1.issue-2/sirius-2017-0026/sirius-2017-0026.pdf online]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhetoric ==
Rhetorically, Trumpism is characterized by a rejection of the political establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Tarnoff: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/us-election-political-movement-trumpism ''The triumph of Trumpism: the new politics that is here to stay.''] In: ''The Guardian'', November 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Trump is also rhetorically proven to act with a large number of [[Disinformation|false or at least misleading statements]], which he presents as facts.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Kessler, Meg Kelly: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/10/president-trump-has-made-more-than-2000-false-or-misleading-claims-over-355-days/ ''President Trump has made more than 2,000 false or misleading claims over 355 days''], in: ''The Washington Post'', January 10, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, a large part of the media is pejoratively called ''fake media'' by Trump because of their resulting critical coverage, while he mainly relies on the conservative channel [[Fox News Channel]], where influential moderators (like [[Sean Hannity]]) support his policies medially. &lt;ref&gt;Jason Schwartz: [https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/trump-media-cnn-fox-fake-news-719279 ''Trump opens rift in press corps as he disses CNN as 'fake' and Fox News as 'real'''], in: ''Politico'', 13 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

There has been an ongoing public debate whether or not Trumpism is a form of fascism.&lt;ref&gt; e.g. https://badgerherald.com/news/2019/04/03/trumpism-is-not-enough-of-a-mass-movement-to-be-facism-visiting-professor-says/, https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/trump-and-the-rhetoric-of-fascism.html, https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/is-trumpism-fascism/ &lt;/ref&gt; The American historian [[Robert Paxton]] evaluates Trumpism as [[proto-fascism ]] because of its [[Xenophobia |xenophobic]] agenda, the repeated thematization of the national decline to be fought, and the rhetorical stylistic devices used.&lt;ref&gt;
https://theindependent.ca/2017/05/13/is-trump-a-fascist/ &lt;/ref&gt; British historian Roger Griffin considers the definition of [[fascism]] not fulfilled, since Trump does not question the [[politics of the United States]] or want to abolish its democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/10/9886152/donald-trump-fascism&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentinean historian [[Federico Finchelstein]] discusses significant intersections between [[Peronism]] and Trumpism since a disregard for the contemporary political system (both in the area of domestic and foreign policy) is discernible.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Finchelstein: ''From Fascism to Populism in History''. University of California, Oakland 2017, {{ISBN|978-0-520-96804-2}}, [https://books.google.de/books?id=jkwsDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 pp. 11-13].&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Christopher Browning]] considers the long-term consequences of Trump's authoritarian policies and the support he receives for them from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to be potentially dangerous to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Browning: ''[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/25/suffocation-of-democracy/ The Suffocation of Democracy].'' In: ''The New York Review of Books'' Vol. 65, Number 16 (2018). Quote ibid.: ''Trump is not Hitler and Trumpism is not Nazism, but regardless of how the Trump presidency concludes, this is a story unlikely to have a happy ending.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the German-speaking debate, the term has so far only appeared sporadically, mostly in connection with the crisis of confidence in politics and the media. It then describes the strategy of mostly right-wing political actors to stir up this crisis in order to profit from it.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothée de Nève: [http://hessenschau.de/politik/gastbeitrag-der-trumpismus-bedroht-die-demokratie-auch-in-hessen,gastbeitrag-trump-100.html ''"Trumpism threatens democracy in Hessen too".''] In: ''Hessenschau'', November 10, 2016; [[Georg Seeßlen]]: [http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/-a-1133299.html ''Language attack of the right-wing populists: Trumpets of Trumpism''.] In: ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The British ''Collins English Dictionary'' named Trumpism after Brexit as one of its "Words of the Year 2016". According to the jury, the term denotes both Trump's [[ideology]] and his characteristic way of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/word-lovers-blog/new/etymology-corner-collins-word-of-the-year-2016,324,HCB.html ''Etymology Corner - Collins Word of the Year 2016.''] In: ''Collinsdictionary.com'', November 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Barry was born Maryanne Trump in [[Queens]] in [[New York City]] on April 5, 1937,&lt;ref name=80th-birthday&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/788258/Maryanne-Trump-Barry-in-pictures-Donald-Trump-sister-photographs-images-birthday |title=Judge Maryanne Trump Barry in pictures: Trump's sister celebrates 80th birthday |last=Foster |first=Alice |date=April 5, 2017 |newspaper=[[Daily Express]] |access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest child of real-estate developer [[Fred Trump]] and [[Mary Anne MacLeod Trump]].{{r|Horowitz (2015)}} She is an elder sister of [[Donald Trump]].{{r|Johnson (2015)|Candlish (2015)}} She attended [[Kew-Forest School]], as did Donald.&lt;ref name="Blair_2000"&gt;{{cite book |pages=[https://archive.org/details/trumps00gwen/page/592 592] |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |date=December 4, 2001 |orig-year=2000 |isbn=9780743210799 |title=The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President |first=Gwenda |last=Blair |url=https://archive.org/details/trumps00gwen/page/592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|243}} She graduated ''cum laude'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Mount Holyoke College]] in 1958,{{r|FJC|Margolick (1992)}}&lt;ref name="Blair_2000"/&gt;{{rp|244}} and a [[Master of Arts]] in public law and government from [[Columbia University]] in 1962.{{r|FJC|Maryanne Desmond (1982)}} She later attended law school, earning her [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Hofstra University School of Law]] in 1974.{{r|FJC}}

==Career==
Barry was an [[Assistant United States Attorney]] for the [[United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey|District of New Jersey]] from 1974 to 1983. She was in the civil division from 1974 to 1975 and in the appeals division from 1976 to 1982, serving as deputy chief of that division from 1976 to 1977 and chief of the division from 1977 to 1982. She served as Executive Assistant United States Attorney from 1981 to 1982. She was First Assistant United States Attorney from 1981 to 1983.{{r|FJC}}

==Federal judicial service==
Barry was nominated by President [[Ronald Reagan]]{{r|Horowitz (2015)}} on September 14, 1983, to a seat on the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] vacated by [[Henry Curtis Meanor]]. She was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on October 6, 1983, and received her commission the next day. In 1985, she recused herself in a drug-trafficking case due to her brother Donald's relationship with the alleged trafficker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/19/the-drug-trafficker-donald-trump-risked-his-casino-empire-to-protect|title=The Drug Trafficker Donald Trump Risked His Casino Empire to Protect|first=David Cay|last=Johnston|date=19 October 2016|website=thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her service terminated on October 25, 1999, due to her elevation to the Third Circuit.{{r|FJC}}

A Republican,{{r|Kamen (2015)}} Barry was nominated to a judgeship on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] by Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]]{{r|Horowitz (2015)}} on June 17, 1999. Barry was nominated to replace [[H. Lee Sarokin]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/barry-maryanne-trump|title=Barry, Maryanne Trump &amp;#124; Federal Judicial Center|website=fjc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had retired in 1996. Clinton had nominated [[Robert Raymar]] to the seat in 1998, but that nomination had expired at the end of the year without being given a hearing by the [[United States Senate Judiciary Committee|Senate Judiciary Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Margolick|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/20/news/yale-alumni-take-lead-again-even-if-not-in-law.html|title=Yale Alumni Take Lead Again, Even If Not in Law|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=March 20, 1992|accessdate=August 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on September 13, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/30/when-president-clinton-did-a-very-nice-thing-for-donald-trump/|title=When President Clinton did a very nice thing for Donald Trump|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received her commission on September 22, 1999.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; "I am deeply honored and very grateful for the nomination," Barry told the ''New Jersey Law Journal'' in 1999. "I am surprised I was approached on it. I assume that my record is good enough as a district court judge to be reached out to, and I'm glad that politics weren't a priority here."{{r|Ackermann (1999)}}

Barry's reputation on the bench was that of a tough judge with strong command of her courtroom.{{r|Horowitz (2015)}} In 1989, while a district court judge in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], she disapproved a [[plea bargain]] that would have freed two county detectives accused of protecting a drug dealer, and forced the case to trial. The detectives were convicted and received jail terms. She also presided over the conviction of [[Louis Manna]], the [[Genovese crime family]] mobster accused of plotting to assassinate rival [[John Gotti]].{{r|Horowitz (2015)}}

In January 2006, Barry testified in support of the appointment of fellow Third Circuit Judge [[Samuel Alito]] to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/politics/2016/02/cruz_attacks_trumps_sister_maryanne_an_nj_judge.html|title=Cruz again attacks Trump's sister, a N.J. judge|first=Claude|last=Brodesser-Akner|date=February 21, 2016|website=nj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2011, Barry assumed [[senior status]].{{r|FJC}} She took inactive senior status in the first week of February 2017, about two weeks after her brother's inauguration as President.{{r|Mannion (2017)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |website=[[CNN]] |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/politics/donald-trump-older-sister-family-finances/index.html |title=A financial disclosure from Donald Trump's sister led to The New York Times report on his taxes |first=Elizabeth |last=Hartfield |date=October 3, 2018 |first2=Erica |last2=Orden |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004030901/https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/politics/donald-trump-older-sister-family-finances/index.html |archive-date=October 4, 2018 |quote=In 2017, she became an inactive judge.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry retired from active judicial service on February 11, 2019. Her retirement brought an end to an investigation of whether she had engaged in fraudulent tax schemes with her siblings that violated judicial conduct rules. The investigation closed without reaching a conclusion as to the merits of the allegations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philly.com/news/trump-sister-judge-maryanne-barry-philadelphia-federal-court-third-circuit-20190411.html|title=Trump's sister retires as federal judge in Philadelphia amid reported probe of family finances|last=Gambardello|first=Joseph A.|date=April 13, 2019|website=philly.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2004, Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] presented Barry with an award, named for O'Connor, that the [[Seton Hall University School of Law]] gives to women who excel in law and public service. At the presentation ceremony, Barry said, "I say to the women out there, remember how difficult it was for women like Justice O'Connor starting out," adding, "Even though she graduated with top grades, she had to take a job as a legal secretary.

===Allegations of tax evasion===
In October 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an investigative report asserting that Barry, along with her father and siblings, had engaged in fraudulent and illegal activity for the purpose of limiting [[estate tax]] and [[gift tax]] liability stemming from Fred Trump's real estate enterprises.&lt;ref name="NYT_Barstow_20181002"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html|title=Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father|last1=Barstow|first1=David |first2=Susanne |last2=Craig |first3=Russ |last3=Buettner|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 2, 2018|access-date=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative journalist [[Susanne Craig]] discovered a critical piece of information in the investigation: a filing Barry had made to the Senate as part of her federal judiciary confirmation in which she had reported a $1 million contribution from All County Building Supply &amp; Maintenance.&lt;ref name="NYT_Smith_20181003"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-times-story-trump-wealth-source-maryanne-document-2018-10|title=New York Times reveals that its bombshell story on Trump's wealth was made possible by a document his sister submitted to the Senate years ago|last=Smith|first=Allan|date=October 3, 2018|work=Business Insider|access-date=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' reported that All County Building Supply &amp; Maintenance was a "sham company" formed in 1992&lt;ref name="NYT_Smith_20181003"/&gt; and owned by Barry, Donald Trump, their siblings, and a cousin. All County Building Supply &amp; Maintenance reportedly paid for work performed at Fred Trump's apartment buildings; those apartment buildings then reimbursed All County Building Supply &amp; Maintenance, but fraudulently added extra money to those reimbursements. Tax experts reportedly indicated that because All County "performed no real work, the transfer of money through the corporation was essentially a gift that evaded the 55 percent tax in place at the time".&lt;ref name="NYT_Buettner_20181215"/&gt; Its address was the [[Manhasset, New York]], residence of John Walter, Fred Trump's nephew.&lt;ref name="NYT_Smith_20181003"/&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt; According to the investigation by ''The Times'', [https://theislandnow.com/news-98/john-walter-flower-hill-mayor-cousin-president-dies/ John Walter (1934 - 2018)] managed Fred Trump's business records. Said records filled the basement of Walter's Manhasset residence. The investigation by ''The Times'' included thousands of documents such as "bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks" and over 200 of Fred Trump's tax returns.&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up article, ''The Times'' reported that the money illicitly earned by All County was split by the Trump siblings.&lt;ref name="NYT_Buettner_20181215"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/us/politics/trump-tenants-taxes.html |date=December 15, 2018 |access-date=December 15, 2018|title=As the Trumps Dodged Taxes, Their Tenants Paid a Price |first1=Russ |last1=Buettner |first2=Susanne |last2=Craig |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, as a result of the publication of ''The Times''' investigation, the [[New York State Department of Taxation and Finance]] began a review of the fraud allegations against Barry and her siblings.&lt;ref name="NYT_Barstow_20181002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Borak_20181003"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes/index.html |title=New York Times investigation: Trump helped his parents evade taxes, 'including instances of outright fraud'|first1=Donna |last1=Borak |first2=Sophie |last2=Tatum |work=CNN |date=October 3, 2018 |access-date=December 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/us/maryanne-trump-barry-misconduct-inquiry.html |title=Retiring as a Judge, Trump's Sister Ends Court Inquiry Into Her Role in Tax Dodges |first1=Russ|last1=Buettner|first2=Susanne|last2=Craig |date=April 10, 2019 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[New York Times Company]] |location=New York City|access-date=April 11, 2019 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
